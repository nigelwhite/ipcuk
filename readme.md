## Background

The intention is to archive https://ipcuk.events which was built in Drupal 7 for the International Permaculture Convergence in London in 2015.

This flat-file site was converted from Drupal 7 by http://www.httrack.com on 2.3.22.

## Issue 1

Internal links now point to targets with /index.html at the end eg

a href="../../about/convergences/index.html"

This results in the display of /index.html in the address bar, which is ugly. We want

http://localhost/ipcuk.events/about/convergences
to display in the address bar.

Such urls will display correctly already in the address bar (without the /index.html) if you copy and paste them into the address bar.

## Issue 2

There were 2 index pages generated by httrack -

index/index.html and

index.html

At the moment all links to the home page point to index/index.html which is not what we want.

## Solution

A solution to both issues is described in this blog https://www.aczoom.com/archive-2016/blog/2014-11-27/creating-a-static-drupal-site where a script is offered.

I think it is suggesting to search the site for all 'a' tags and remove the /index.html from the end. So

a href="../../about/convergences/index.html"

would become

a href="../../about/convergences".

There is also provision in the script to change the links to the homepage.

Unfortunately the description of the steps to implement the solution is not described in enough detail for me to replicate them.

Morning, morning.  Morning Jerome how are you.  Jerome is good excellent.  Nice\~to\~see you all back I think there's a smaller number of people, I think there's about 15 missing so\~far \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} something along those lines.  \line \tab       Great ok.  Actually }{\*\bkmkstart ldl51}{\*\bkmkend ldl51}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}I will move over to this because I have\~got too much paper, lots of announcements.  \line \tab       Ok great that's much better.  Ok hello, and welcome back everyone.  We have another wonderful offering today, a huge thanks to Alara last night for throwing the party for }{\*\bkmkstart ldl101}{\*\bkmkend ldl101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}us really fantastic.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  Thank you to, Teresa the convergence crew KMT and the really wonderful young rappers the Incredible Vegetable Sound System.  They were incredible.  A fantastic and slightly crazy night.  A few people had a bit of\~a hard time at the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl151}{\*\bkmkend ldl151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}back of\~the queue, sorry for that thanks so much for you patience very\~much appreciated, but basically really fantastic evening and thanks to everyone that put all\~the work in it to make it such a good night.  \line \tab       I think it's often my, well someone in my role's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl201}{\*\bkmkend ldl201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}task to summarise the day before, and I am sure you will all agree that would be difficult.  So many different sessions and speakers and different perspectives which was really kind of one of\~the points about this was\~to get so many different perspectives on so }{\*\bkmkstart ldl251}{\*\bkmkend ldl251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}many different topics, create the neural networks in here but out there somehow.  \line \tab       A few things stand out for\~me.  Phrases that people said, things that I listened into it.  One was working with the best in everyone, trying to\~avoid the \uc1\u8216\'91us }{\*\bkmkstart ldl301}{\*\bkmkend ldl301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and them\uc1\u8217\'92 kind of situation.  The importance of finding ways to connect with other people with their positive change and possibilities in different places maybe unexpected places.  Big NGOs, Government, businesses.  It seems really clear to me from yesterday }{\*\bkmkstart ldl351}{\*\bkmkend ldl351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}there\~are many really sympathetic people that really support what we're doing in lots of different places.  It's up\~to us to recognise that a bit more and work with them so working with the best in everyone stood out.  \line \tab       Another one I found really powerful was just }{\*\bkmkstart ldl401}{\*\bkmkend ldl401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}finding out more about the way that permaculture engages with indigenous people.  350 million people that you call indigenous.  That's bigger than the United\~States of America.  How permaculture resonates and helps them toe strengthen their own knowledge and power.  I find that really great from }{\*\bkmkstart ldl451}{\*\bkmkend ldl451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}two perspectives is one is they are under such enormous pressure, anything we can do to help those people is fantastic.  \line \tab       In helping we learn as well, because we have got a lot\~to learn from those people, so that seems to me to be }{\*\bkmkstart ldl501}{\*\bkmkend ldl501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a really beautiful productive relationship that we could nurture more.  \line \tab       A third one kind of relates to David Holmgren's top down thinking, bottom up action.  It just seems so clear that building up a local base of real practical action, real example is so }{\*\bkmkstart ldl551}{\*\bkmkend ldl551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}important.  That's remember all the action happens, in England we say at the coal face, right up in that spot remember it's all happening.  Again this can be really strengthened and duplicated and replicated in so many more ways when we engage with people in }{\*\bkmkstart ldl601}{\*\bkmkend ldl601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Government and regional level or national level or with other organisations.  Again some fantastic examples yesterday of grass roots action meeting kind of, Government structure, some sort of organisation which was then able to take that expand it out in\~a very interesting way.  So I would }{\*\bkmkstart ldl651}{\*\bkmkend ldl651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}like to see how we could learn from that a bit more.  \line \tab       Ok.  So, today, we are looking at pathways to transformation.  How do we get from here, to where we really want to be.  We know that we can design and }{\*\bkmkstart ldl701}{\*\bkmkend ldl701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}put in place pretty much everything we need for a really genuinely sustainable and socially just society.  Of course it's not going to be perfect, it never will\~be.  There's one thing kind of knowing it's possible, and there's another thing is actually making it happen.  The }{\*\bkmkstart ldl751}{\*\bkmkend ldl751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}scale of\~a challenge, I am not going\~to emphasise it I am sure you can all think this to yourself just how big the challenge is that we face.  \line \tab       Today is really important, it's not just about we can do all this, it\uc1\u8217\'92s can we do it all, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl801}{\*\bkmkend ldl801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}how can we make\~it happen what are the pathways to transformation.  \line \tab       Amongst other things it's about behaviour change, social change, design thinking, cultural shifts, politics, economics, and I am very pleased that there\~are 3 very wonderful speaks that can }{\*\bkmkstart ldl851}{\*\bkmkend ldl851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}help us think about that this morning.  \line \tab       Before we get to that I have\~got some announcements.  So there\~are a small number of session changes, they are on your sheet but I will just draw them to your\~attention.  If you were expecting to go to\~the enabling change workshop }{\*\bkmkstart ldl901}{\*\bkmkend ldl901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}today, it\~was yesterday.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} Carlin Monastra whose wonderful climate change photographs are around the reception area will\~be holding a meet the artist workshop in room 1 at lunch time.  The film later tonight at 5.45, }{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Design For Life}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} is in\~the small hall, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl952}{\*\bkmkend ldl952}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Permaculture In Schools}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} is in George Fox.  I have seen bits of both of them I want to see the rest basically so I encourage you to go and see them.  \line \tab       I have been asked by some of the African scholars to say if you are from }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1001}{\*\bkmkend ldl1001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Africa, they would really love to get all of you together outside on\~the grass at lunch or just after the beginning of lunch at one o'clock so a little African meeting at one go clock outside on the grass.  \line \tab       Rabina McCurdy, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1051}{\*\bkmkend ldl1051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}if you have\~got any seeds with you she would love to know about it so she can use them for a celebration let, so Rabina just go \uc1\u8216\'91wooh!\uc1\u8217\'92 }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

Geoff is a permaculture consultant, designer and teacher.  First took his design course in 1983 with Bill Mollison and since then Geoff has under taken thousands of job, teaching, designing and implementing in 6 countries, private individuals, groups, communities, governments, organisations, NGOs and multinational companies.  He has currently educated over 15,000 students, partly by his online training and education website Geoff Lawton.com, which was established with the aim of educating as many people as possible in permaculture and environmental sustainability.  In 1996 Geoff was awarded the award for services in Australia and around the world and Geoff runs the permaculture research institute in, of Australia, which is located in New South Wales.  That institute has gone to support the founding of a network of PIRN sites around the world including }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}United States, Jordon, sunshine coast, Chile, Scotland and Zealand.  Geoff is very well-known as a filmmaker with his colleague, frank, and some very fab inspiring films that are just reaching such, just a big bigger audience.  I think, yeah, feels to me that Geoff really has found his niche.  It's with very great pleasure that I introduce Geoff Lawton \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line GEOFF LAWTON:  It's great to be presenting here in my home country.  I was born in Stoke-on-Trent in Staffordshire in 1954.  My parents moved to Bournemouth in 1956.  When I went to school and grew up fishing in the Stour and the Avon, on the Hampshire and Dorset coast, I love that coast line, studying the forest ecology, specially the new forest and its Commons, which I feel privileged to have visited, I moved to North Devon in 1974 and winter travelling, almost out of necessity as an English server!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  That led me to Australia in 1979, it was in that first year that I came across permaculture.  I've become more involved every year since.  Now, in 2015, I'll be 61 this year and I'm pretty sure it's a terminal infection!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  . \line \tab       I don't think I'm going to recover! }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

I don't know.  Have we got 7 million who have heard the word \~'permaculture' yet, it's the other 99% of 99.9% who are the real audience. \line \tab       Throughout our existence the human race has been responsible for creating tremendously harmful imbalances impacting living and non-living systems of the earth.  Our planet is currently suffering unparalleled rate of species extinction and biodiversity losses, symptoms and large indicators of really major evil in action.  Ecosystems on a world-wide scale are unable to endure the continuous negative human forces.  A major climate stabilisers they are, they are collapsing across the world, across the earth they are collapsing, they are our stabilisers.  The life-rich systems are the shock absorbers, like shock absorbers in the car, take out the vicious bounces, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:1001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}they allow for points of balance to be restored after massive fluctuations in energy, such as hurricanes and cyclones and other natural catastrophe, without them our own existence comes into question as well. \line \tab       Energy systems can also be thought of as energy stores.  Energy storage systems with expressions of full diversity from the top predator to the mass weight life diversity expressed in soul organisms where much of the life weight is an indicator of energy charge capacity.  Energy being constant - quote Einstein.  As we simplify and destroy global ecosystems our climate becomes more energetic, yeah.  The energy has to go somewhere.  The variations in our global climate extremes are more volatile every year and... exponentially increasing.  In every region of the world we are experiencing record breaking extremes in all directions, simultaneously reaching the upper limits of one system and the barest bounds of another.  The hottest, the coldest, the biggest drought, the biggest fluids, the biggest winds.  Everywhere world-wide at the same time.  This doesn't have to be the reality we are living.  We know the attitude, we know the approach and the science which can cure all that ails us, after 25 years of designing, teaching and consulting on every continent throughout the world I feel the solution is very obvious.  With permaculture design we cannot only impede our current negative effect, we can reverse it into a positive one with potent potential, with the potential of permaculture like an infectious global pandemic.  We have into effect people so they are infections.  All you have to do is hone in and pay close attention to the natural systems.  Through our enhanced observation skills anyone can see the very obvious cause and effect reactions in all biological systems, using climatic moderation and ecosystems species' richness as gauges, positive feedback loops intensify beneficial effects, is what those people and the environment need, positive feedback loops, intensifying beneficial effects.  A massive increase in positive feedback loops. \line \tab       Permaculture specialises in this field, finding beneficial interactions between elements and creating as many of these connections as possible. \line \tab  We need an evolution of the way we think.  It's now recorded neural science where we can see one synapse in the brain fire with ultrasound accuracy that we now have.  Let us believe we actually grew a slightly bigger brain at }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1501}{\*\bkmkend ldl1501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the \uc1\u8216\'91I\uc1\u8217\'92 point where we start to read and write and describe the world in actual writing with numbers and letters and words.   There\~was an evolution in our brains.  I think that's what we do to people when we teach them permaculture, we put that final shine on that neural }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1551}{\*\bkmkend ldl1551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}cortex the outer brain gets just a fraction bigger, that last fractal, that design mind evolution, I get worried about what we do to students.

So it's pretty serious.  The approach of permaculture design can solve all of\~the global challenges appearing down on our strained biosphere.  Our initial action should be to stabilise our systems, only then can we, and we absolutely without a }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1651}{\*\bkmkend ldl1651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}doubt can too, this convert these systems into reliable, consistent and permanent resources possessing true and useful value.   The problem is\~the solution.  Every problem is a potential opportunity.  It's up to us to change our perceptions, it's up\~to us to allow for }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1701}{\*\bkmkend ldl1701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}unlimited abundance and positivity, with our vision of\~the emergent future we can all achieve together.  \line \tab       It starts with ethics.  It's about ethics.  It's about design.  It's about science.  Ethical design science.  First and for most we must engage with our current water }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1751}{\*\bkmkend ldl1751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}management and access crisis.  Water is essential to life systems.  Our first speaker spoke about that quite well in the history of snowball earth and water events.  \line \tab       We look for it on other planets because it\uc1\u8217\'92s the chief indicator for a world's ability to conceive }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1801}{\*\bkmkend ldl1801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and sustain complex life forms.   When we look at another planet if there\uc1\u8217\'92s a chance there's water there, there's a chance there's life there.  That's how we look at the universe.  Personally I have been fascinated by water all my life I have been intensely engaged }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1852}{\*\bkmkend ldl1852}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in all its aspects, from small scale harvest systems built by hand to immense landscapes built with enormous earth moving machines.  I have an in-depth understanding and a long lasting expertise with aquatic dynamics and their crucial role in building life rich systems.  \line \tab       In the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1901}{\*\bkmkend ldl1901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}extreme climates and landscapes, water is\~the priority in design.  Yep, clean drinking water is becoming extremely rare.  In the natural world, and is now becoming only a manufactured product in most locations.  That's pretty sad.  \line \tab       The World Health Organisation reports that's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1951}{\*\bkmkend ldl1951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}more than 750 million people lack access to clean drinking water.

Irrigation water is also in more demand all the time.  Ridiculously in more demand all\~the time.  Industrial agriculture is increasing the world\uc1\u8217\'92s dependency on irrigation technology.  That's clever.  Due to\~its action without regard to holistic integration of natural systems }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2051}{\*\bkmkend ldl2051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we're just going to go the technology route towards irrigation technology.  \line \tab       The signs of water strain globally are the flood and drought regimes which are increasing.

We }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2152}{\*\bkmkend ldl2152}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}have an obligation and a responsibility to achieve this, as an evolutionary process.  As a species, I know we found the holistically designed science system capable of this feat.  Permaculture is\~the vehicle of our evolution.   \line \tab       Water has so many constants.  Of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2201}{\*\bkmkend ldl2201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}all the elements on earth water has probably the most constants in the way it behaves.

Water defies gravity somewhat.  First water, the mantra of\~a designer, first water then access, then structural positions before anything else.  \line \tab       The other large-scale challenge created by }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2301}{\*\bkmkend ldl2301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}industrial agriculture is soil depletion.  It's degrading and destroying soil fertility and physically eroding soils on a global scale at permanent loss rate faster than ever before in history.

Nothing else give you that indicator.  Nothing.  A sustainable }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2401}{\*\bkmkend ldl2401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}system produces more energy than it consumes and enough to maintain and repair its component parts over the life times, end of story, that\~is sustainable systems you don't need\~to\~waffle on about it.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} By measuring and improving soil quality by creating new soil with appropriate interactions }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2452}{\*\bkmkend ldl2452}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we can begin the journey towards soil abundance.

World-wide hunger }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2851}{\*\bkmkend ldl2851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is growing.  It's not slowing down.  The sad fact is more children go hungry every day.

The definition of wealth has been manipulated, disfigured, mutated, if you will.  We have been led astray.  We have been led astray with the media, social media, multimedia, world wide web, weapon.  Every weapon can be a tool.  We need to tool that right around.  We need to move the goal posts, we need to alter our aspirations.  We need to do this and when we, when we do this, when we achieve true wealth and not only understanding, but using permaculture design as the directive for positive action, we have, as a birth right, very basic requirements in life that we are entitled to.  I feel, as an international community, we should make every possible effort to reclaim these basics in order to become truly wealthy, the core requirements of true prosperity, an abundance of clean air and water, abundance of clean, nutritious food, with these fundamentals in place we can continue on to create an abundance of sensible, passive, low energy design housing, there were providing an abundantly supportive community, unified in action by permaculture ethics, this will create the ultimate evolution in humanity's potential, the revolution is no longer disguised as gardening, but obvious sedition and people power, a meaningful existence full fills us, we need to progress on from where we are to where we want to be.  This, in itself, is a very meaningful process, with the widespread adoption of permaculture design globally, we will have no need for industrial agriculture in its present, intensive form.  Conventional, chemical, as well as organic farming both lack sensitivity for global patterning, appropriate scale and beneficial positioning of interactive diversity.  Industrial agriculture is inherently inefficient, obviously and inherently unsustainably, we have been teaching people how rapidly make soil on small scale for many years, with specific techniques and local compost, it's feasible to design productive systems to facilitate the production of soil over large areas.  Mass education is now possible for all.  I stand before you as testament to that.  All children and adults willing to learn can be completely fluent in this patterned language to a level of understanding that can be expressed in eloquence.  I've always been worried about my carbon credits, I was never sure if I should stop flying and create a Findhorn .  Facebook said I was wrong, when I signed on to Facebook and friended everybody that wanted to friend me it went a bit mad, my advisers said I was nuts, they made me a public figure and it kept going, people kept saying, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:2001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}"I'm here because of you", a connection and so on and so on, I paid my carbon credits and so on, I can keep flying!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  Then... I came across a block that had an average of 30 students, I'm now going to be able to teach all the people that I need to teach.  I thought how do I teach a thousand people on every course, or more.  I came up with a system where I taught 30 years worth of students in 12 weeks on a face to face ratio and got a better result than any face to face courses I ever taught.  I say a better result, because the students went into action and produced designs 20% of them, }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} could never do in my wildest dreams as\~long\~as I lived, they're better designs than I can actually do, I have never seen that before, I am 90 years in front, I have just bought 90 years of carbon credits!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}.  Let's strive towards positive solutions, it's essential that international permaculture design is adopted as the core of all relevant science, with our ethics at the core as we go into action.  Then and only then, will we engage as a serious effect, a serious effort and effect for all people.  We'll start to implement and invest in a completely global extension of true sustainability that will prepare the Earth and create absolutely abundance, the current crisis is actually our ultimate opportunity to evolve, as a species.  We have been presented with a chance to learn from the transformation we have to make.  The path from the negative death and destruction economy, rooted in the production and consumption system must begin.  We have a duty to advance in the expansive economy of ecology, producing a balanced global economy with a sustainable earth for all future generations there is no limit to richness in natural systems the more we egg in }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}permaculture}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} design systems the more intricate and refined they become.  I stand with the core ethics that govern our actions and by allowing the systems we implement to demonstrate their evolutions, we will inevitably create a world so abundant it will exceed the edges of our present imagination.  True worlds will become endlessly available to us, truth wealth is achievable by design and now is the time, our ethos of taking action is to make sure that we care for the Earth, care for each other and leave a positive legacy for future generations.  A complete transformation of humanity's action is possible, we can grow from the most destructive species on earth and return to the rightful facilitators of earth's function through permaculture design, our common goal union vice the global community and is our true inheritance.

We can very optimistic that this can be achieved as everything we need to know is available to us.  There needs to be a global effort to redesign the systems that meet our basic needs along ecological principles.

Cathy Debenham was there at the beginning of the shift, perceived of the idea for YouGen was born when Cathy renovated her house in 2005 she wanted to make it as low carbon as possible.  Having weighed up the alternatives she got quotes for a wood pellet boiler, but none of the suppliers would look at the house, the top and bottom quotes varied by \'a34,000 and the advice agency couldn't help to give advice on prices.  So Cathy gave up the idea of buying a pellet stove and brought a condensing gas boiler but noted a gap in the market, she thought she could put her experience to better use than she was and instead follow her passion for finding better ways of living.  In 2009 YouGen was born and is now one of the leading online forums of renewable energy.  Cathy is going to talk to us about how renewables have gone from fringe to the near normal and the lessons that this may have for permaculture.  Cathy.  }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

Giving people the confidence to go ahead and quite new unfamiliar technology, but before I share what I }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3351}{\*\bkmkend ldl3351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}have learnt I am just going to tell you a bit about my first experience with renewable energy just\~to illustrate where things were 10 years ago, and to compare it with where they are today.  \line \tab       We'd bought a 1950s house, it\~was structurally sound but it had not changed }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3402}{\*\bkmkend ldl3402}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}much since it\~was built.  It needed quite a\~lot of renovation I want\~to make\~it as energy efficient as I could but I didn't\~know anything about how to do it and where to start.  The internet is not quite what it is today I couldn't find much online it\~was ringing }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3451}{\*\bkmkend ldl3451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}people up getting leaflets through the door stuff like that.  \line \tab       One of\~the things as Andy just mentioned was the gas boiler was on its last legs, and we knew that we were going to have to replace it started looking at renewable heat as an alternative, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3502}{\*\bkmkend ldl3502}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}what might we use what might be available.  I found lots of information about the various renewable technologies but most of them focused on the technology behind them how solar panels turn the heat and light from the sun into electricity.  What I wanted to know }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3551}{\*\bkmkend ldl3551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}was the practical stuff, was it suitable for my house, would it work with my existing heating and plumbing system, what about the carbon emissions, how would they compare with a condensing gas boiler for\~example.  From what I read the biomass boiler seemed the most }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3601}{\*\bkmkend ldl3601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}like to suit us.  Next I want to find out how\~much it\~was going to cost, things like that.  There were only 2 suppliers in\~the south-west, neither would come\~to my house to do a survey, both quoted over the phone, with no accurate }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3651}{\*\bkmkend ldl3651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}figures about the size of the house and more importantly now figures about the heat demand of the house and you heard there\~was an enormous difference between the most expensive and the cheapest.  Hoping to get some expert advice on what it cost and how to assess what the quotes said }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3701}{\*\bkmkend ldl3701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and how to compare them, I found the energy saving trust, an advice charity that was the that time funded by government to help people make their homes more energy efficient.  \line \tab       They said, sorry can't help you this is a commercial decision.  Oh. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3751}{\*\bkmkend ldl3751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}So that commercial decision is not actually at the time when you need that help most.  So we bought a gas condensing boiler, we installed a wood burning stove in the living room, we're very happy that's what we did.  Were I in the same situation }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3801}{\*\bkmkend ldl3801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}now, it would be easy to find loads of good sources of information, the problem is now there\~are probably too many and you can't work out which is\~the best.  I could use forums to ask how their boiler works I would have a choice of 30 installers }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3851}{\*\bkmkend ldl3851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}within a 30 mile radius, south-west is particularly full of renewable energy things I could look on YouGen to see which installers had been recommended by their customers.  I get government incentive payments for 7 years.  Back then it seemed safer and infinitely cheaper to go with }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3902}{\*\bkmkend ldl3902}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}what I knew, now there\~is really much more choice.  \line \tab       As\~a\~result of this experience I noticed the need for an independent source of practical advice, and that there\~was a gap in the market.  The idea just kept nagging away at me having initially thought there's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3951}{\*\bkmkend ldl3951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a gap there for someone to fill, I began to think, maybe I can do it.  I started exploring it in earnest in 2007, in April 2009 the full website was launched.  Our vision was of\~a UK }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4001}{\*\bkmkend ldl4001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}where homes are energy efficient and local power generation from renewable source is\~the normal.  Our purpose for people to get information they to be confident they\~are making a good decision about renewable energy that might\~be that it's not suitable for them.  We also wanted to help them find an }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4051}{\*\bkmkend ldl4051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}installer they could trust, and began to come to\~the site.  On those early days, every comment on the blog, every installer that signed up, each person that left a review it\~was really exciting.  \line \tab       Earlier this year the website was getting 60,000 visits a month }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4101}{\*\bkmkend ldl4101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we were still enjoying reading all\~the comments and questions.  More than 1.5 million people have used it since it launched.  I ran YouGen until March this year when it moved to\~a new home at the energy foundation, it sits comfortable there alongside complementary side such as Superhomes }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4152}{\*\bkmkend ldl4152}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and LogPile.  The invitation to speak here came just after I handed over the reins to NEF.   A perfect time to look back over what we had achieved, what had worked well, and just as importantly, what had not worked.  This }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4202}{\*\bkmkend ldl4202}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}talk also gave me the reason to do that.  I have picked out the things that might be most of use to you, in encouraging or supporting the wider take up of permaculture.  \line \tab       Now my first point is that timing is everything.  If I }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4251}{\*\bkmkend ldl4251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}had launched YouGen in 2005 it would have almost certainly sunk without trace there wasn't enough interest in renewables at that stage.  3 key developments made it possible.  First was the introduction of Web 2.0, we're so used to interactive websites now, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4301}{\*\bkmkend ldl4301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}it seems bizarre to think that actually they are really, really quite new.  Just 7 years ago, people were still figuring out how to make this exciting development work.  Facebook and Twitter were also in their infancy.  Being, we were really lucky }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4351}{\*\bkmkend ldl4351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we started up just as they were coming on stream, being in at the beginning made it possible to reach like minded people with no marketing budget, I am sure it\uc1\u8217\'92s the marketing budget bit is also important for permaculture.  \line \tab       Being on Twitter }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4401}{\*\bkmkend ldl4401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}early enabled us to develop a really strong presence as a leader in the sector, something that would be really difficult now.  Most significantly in July 2009, the government issued a consultation document on\~the financial incentives for renewable energy, kicking off a whole new }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4451}{\*\bkmkend ldl4451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}level of interest in renewables.  Of\~course, whether you have got your timing right or\~not, is much easier to see in retrospect, but it's always worth asking is now the right time before you launch anything new.  \line \tab       One of the joys of the interactive website }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4501}{\*\bkmkend ldl4501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}your users will tell you what their priorities are.  It\uc1\u8217\'92s very likely that they won't want the information that you think they will.  When I plan the layout of the website I thought visitors would be asking about things I struggled with, their difficulties getting independent advice }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4551}{\*\bkmkend ldl4551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that looked at the whole house, why the price variations were so high, or how you could compare carbon emissions.  They did want to know these things, but those types of questions were absolutely dwarfed by their confusion over\~the financial incentives.  I become }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4601}{\*\bkmkend ldl4601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}an expert in the minutiae in the three major government schemes; the feed-in tariff, the renewable heat incentive and the Green Deal.  I explained the rules I investigated why energy companies were so slow paying the feed-in tariff, that solar power }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4651}{\*\bkmkend ldl4651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}was no good anymore, once the tariff fell the list goes on and on.  By the time the domestic renewable heat incentive eventually became a reality, Government realised that independent forums are significant in helping the market work.  \line \tab       Ofgem invited our users to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4701}{\*\bkmkend ldl4701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}test the application form for the new incentive as they built it so they were getting real time feedback from people who were actually wanting to apply.  Lots of our users were really happy to take part in that.  The department for energy and climate change invited me }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4751}{\*\bkmkend ldl4751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to join its working group on consumer protection, I was of an Ofgem forum as well, this gave me much better access\~to civil servants and a much better chance to get our views heard.  \line \tab       My Q and A blog on the renewable heat incentive is one of the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4801}{\*\bkmkend ldl4801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}most visited on\~the YouGen website.  Most of\~the information on it can be found on a whole load of different websites, but the great advantage than the interactive site like YouGen has is that visitors can ask there's questions get an answer reasonably quickly.  Because of it's independence it can }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4851}{\*\bkmkend ldl4851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}take a strong view which official sites are unable\~to\~do.  \line \tab       For every one person asking a question there\~are probably loads and loads of other wanting to know the answer.  As long as you have got a good search facility on a website or forum they are really good ways of answering the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4901}{\*\bkmkend ldl4901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}questions and making sure that those answers reach a much wider audience, and also it means you don't have to answer the same questions over and over and over again.  \line \tab       One of\~the biggest challenges I faced setting up YouGen you just don't know if something }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4951}{\*\bkmkend ldl4951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is going to work until you try it.  I have got lots of experience marketing, where you can generally test a campaign before you send out all\~the material and tweak to\~it see if you can improve how it does, but when you\~are building a website there's not always an }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5001}{\*\bkmkend ldl5001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}option of dipping your toe in the water, sometimes you just have to hold your nose and jump straight in at the deep end.  One challenging area for us was advertising.  In\~the early days we used Google which serves up relevant text adverts based on\~the content }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5051}{\*\bkmkend ldl5051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of each page of your website.  We got really good returns from it, much better than average.  Then we noticed that the adverts were serving up tended to be for all\~the dodgiest cowboy installers out there were completely undermining our directory of installers }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5102}{\*\bkmkend ldl5102}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}on the site and of\~course our values.  So Google AdWords and the useful income it generated had to go.  \line \tab       Next we tried a so-called ethical feed of adverts, it didn't make so much money, it also fed completely inappropriate adverts in\~a rather }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5151}{\*\bkmkend ldl5151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}different way, \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} so reluctantly because none of us were good at telesales at all, we brought advertising in house.  \line \tab       On a course I went on some years ago, the trainer kept saying there's no failure, only feedback.  Then I found that }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5201}{\*\bkmkend ldl5201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a bit trite I couldn't quite get my head round it but running YouGen has taught me the truth of it. I have learnt so much more from trying, seeing what happens and responding to feedback, than from books or from training courses but of\~course, you }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5251}{\*\bkmkend ldl5251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}permaculture guys you know\~the true value of feedback.  \line \tab       My next point is be specific about who you want to reach.  Even massive global companies like coca-cola don't target everyone.  For smaller enterprises it's particularly important to know that you know who it is that you }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5301}{\*\bkmkend ldl5301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}want\~to engage, I am going\~to give you an example here of 3 audiences that we targeted for YouGen.  \line \tab       Firstly I wanted to reach early adopters of renewable energy.  I hope that their stories and tips from their experiences they would share them on\~the website }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5351}{\*\bkmkend ldl5351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and help other people but also if appropriate we wanted to recommend their installer.  \line \tab       Our main audience was users, people who might be interested in renewable energy.  So that we could think about how can we find these people, how can we target them with }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5401}{\*\bkmkend ldl5401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}our marketing, we put together characteristics of those who were the most like to be getting involved right at the beginning.  It\~was still pretty expensive back then, so they had\~to have some spare money.  So we taught they would probably be older people whose children have }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5451}{\*\bkmkend ldl5451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}left home, they might be living off\~the gas grid where heating is much more expensive so the more incentive to change.  Probably they would be well educated, and so then we started thinking, ok where do they shop, what clubs will they be }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5501}{\*\bkmkend ldl5501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in so we could find those people.  \line \tab       Our third key market was installers.  I didn't just want any old installer on the site, but just the ones that readers could trust.  So we positioned ourselves as offering word of mouth on\~the web and }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5551}{\*\bkmkend ldl5551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we tried to appeal to those who care about their reputation who get much of their work through word of mouth.  \line \tab       As well as the markets we wanted to reach, it\~was also really important that we identified the ones that we didn't want to reach.  An }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5601}{\*\bkmkend ldl5601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}example of that is the green building forum which probably quite a\~lot of you know.  It\uc1\u8217\'92s a great place where green building professionals share and discuss ideas alongside self builders and DIYers.  Its audience are the type of people who get a new gadget }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5651}{\*\bkmkend ldl5651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}they want to take\~it apart and see how it works.  Ours were the people who want to know how to make\~it work and preferably as little involvement from them as possible.  This kind of positioning is important.  Although my intention when I set up YouGen was to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5701}{\*\bkmkend ldl5701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}contribute to a reduction of carbon emissions in the UK, I took a conscious decision that it would\~not be a green website, instead we recognised that people have a range of motivations for installing renewable energy, and are place was to answer questions like is it }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5751}{\*\bkmkend ldl5751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}suitable, will it be effective, and to prevent people making expensive mistakes.  \line \tab       So for\~example in\~the early days of the solar rush, there\~was a\~lot of disproving muttering on twitter about solar bling, how you should insulate first before you }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5801}{\*\bkmkend ldl5801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}use renewable energy.  That's how I feel, we didn't join in\~the moralising, sometimes it's better to meet people where they are and move on from there it turns out that generating solar electricity really connects people with energy as they generate it they understand it better and% }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5851}{\*\bkmkend ldl5851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}more interested in other often more disruptive things they can do be more energy efficient.  \line \tab       The other thing I know from a marketing background is that just giving people information about how something works, it's not enough.  It's also important to tell our visitor why they might }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5901}{\*\bkmkend ldl5901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}consider investing in renewable energy.  In marketing speak, we translated features into benefits.  Those of you who know about marketing will know how important this is, it helps people know whether something is relevant to them.  So for example, if, here in London, we put a 4 kilowatt array of solar panels on the roof, one of the features would be it would generate 4,000 kilowatts of electricity a year, that doesn't mean much to most people, what they want to know is if they generate 4,000 kilowatts of energy what does it do for them, what are }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:3001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the benefits?  That will depend on their motivations.  If they are worried about a carbon footprint it will be the footprint, it may be safer, if they are approaching retirement it might be the feed-in tariff will give them a better return on their investment than an annuity would. \line \tab       Since I was asked to do this talk I've read quite a lot about permaculture and most of what I've read has focused on the features and it hasn't talked about the benefits at all.  Whether it's encouraging people to go on horses, to buy permaculture produce or to change how they live, people need to know what's in it for them and the planet and other things, but umm... start, most people, it starts with them. \line \tab       I started by saying that renewable energy wouldn't have taken off at such a rate without the government incentives.  So it's difficult to equate the potential growth of permaculture to that of renewables because I'm pretty sure, as the government slashes away at the renewable funding it's not going to be doling out money for permaculture. \line \tab       So - but before you start thing about user forums, I think also that, as a community, you could start thing, you could think hard about how you make it as easy as possible for people to access permaculture.  Over the past few weeks I've asked quite a lot of people, have they heard of permaculture and, if so, what do you think it is.  The good news is that most people say yes to the first question, but they are pretty sketchy in their answers to the second.  Gardening, compositing toilets, organic gardening, planting that right stage of the moon, messy gardens, not weeding, no\~one had a holistic picture.  I'm not surprised, you don't make it that easy!  Ethics, then twelve principles, once you have digested them you can go on a two day introductory course, then there is the jargon.  When I was wondering which seminar to attend this morning, there were some talks that I had no idea from the blurb or title what they were about, for someone new to a subject that's quite off-putting.  So I ask you to think how much of the language you use is exclusive?  Are you doing it on purpose!?  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line \tab       \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line \tab       User forums can be a very effective way of growing a community.  They can just as easily become cliquey and exclude people.  Whether you have an information website or a user forum I would like to leave you with three suggestions that I hope will be helpful in trying to make permaculture more mainstream.  First, use plain English or the equivalent in your country and avoid jargon.  Secondly, tell people what's in it for them, what are the benefits.  I think this is }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:3501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}probably my most important one, meet them where they are, welcome them in, help them with what they are interested in.  This way they may just adapt their life in a small way, or they maybe inspired to try more and adopt more of the permaculture principles.  Either way they are treading more lightly on the planet and positive messages about permaculture will spread more widely.  Thank you \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line ANDY GOLDRING:  Ok.  That was really great.  We really wanted to get some excellent perspectives, thank you for doing you research, that's really appreciated.  The next speaker needs almost no introduction.  Our next speaker is Rob Hopkins, described by David Holmgren as one of the, "Great achievers of permaculture activision."  Holding of a Diploma in Permaculture Design and co-founder of the transition movement, grown from just two groups in 2006 to over 1,107 initiatives in 43 countries, probably bigger than that since I got the statistics, all across the world.  Famous blogger, written and co-written numerous books as well as being a fine cartoonist, it's with great pleasure I introduce Rob Hopkins \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line ROB HOPKINS:  Good morning.  How do I do the thingy with the moving pictures thing...?  Marvellous, thank you.  Well George W Bush, not normally somebody I start talks by quoting, once addressed a meeting of banker said, "Some people call you the elite, I call you my base", well you are my base, it's fantastic to be here \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line \tab       Picking up on what was said, I did my Permaculture Design course in 1992, it rewired my brain, since then it's been the lens through which I've seen the world, I used to do cartoons from the permaculture magazine, this was one of my favourites I found the other day - \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} - those of you that do dry lands permaculture, you will understand the }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}gelatinous}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} tide that envelopes us.  I did the Diploma in 2006, I did the first design course in the world, in Ireland and had a great time and did lots of that stuff.  In 2004 David Holmgren's book came at and rewired my brain again.  It said, basically, we need to scale this stuff up really, really fast.  So, really, since then my kind of driving question has really been: how do we scale this stuff up how do we take those design principles that are.  So awesome and fantastic and Geoff said are the foundation of a sustainable world, beautiful, abundant, nourishing world how do we scale that stuff up?  For me transition was really }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:4001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}based on the idea of a Trojan Horse in effect, I read this and I was like, come on then, let's sort this out, looking at the permaculture people around me that time, people often seem quite happy in a kind of a niche, in a community as you said Cathy where people are talking the same language and, it didn't feel, we need not some way of scaling this up, I thought what did it look like if we had a Trojan Horse that we can put permaculture principles in, I was thinking what the guy is thinking, in the horse, what me, I thought U people would come with me - \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} - how do we put other principals in there, other stuff as well so it can be wheeled past everybody, so without getting the flipchart and the greenhouse and the chickens,, "Oh it's transition', there it goes!  For me I did the permaculture diploma presentation in 1996, so for me having been aware and not being so involved in permaculture for a while this feels like a 19 years later diploma session update, so I want to share some of the stuff I've been involved with since then, which is based around the question of how do we scale that stuff up. \line \tab       One of the things I'm working on at the moment is a project called 21 transition stories where we put an invitation out to transition groups in 50 groups around the world and ask for the stories to take to Paris in December to share there and say, look actually this is a lot more than just carbon these are communities cutting carbon but doing so much more other stuff as well at the same time, stories for 15 countries from around the world, I want to share some of them with you and draw some of the learnings that might inform this morning's panel. \line \tab       So this is the first one of these stories, Black Isle in Scotland, the million miles project where they set out to reduce the amount of car travel on the peninsula, by a 1m miles, they cut it by 1,300,000 miles, they led to 131,000 more miles being cycled, 718 saved of carbon and led to 74,000 miles being walked.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line \tab       I had a great time and got to meet more people and built resilience reweaving people back together again.  This is about community energy which Cathy was talking about, one of the things that has been most exciting in transition is this kind of and in 5,000 communities, not all mine by }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:4501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}any stretch of the imagination, transition, community action is - transition Brixton.  We put together seven different community energy companies that had come through transition and totalled up they brought in about 13m pounds of investment from local people.  Generated enough electricity this for 36,000 homes, saved about 9,000 tonnes of carbon the key thing with those projects is that community energy is just a key to unlock as\~much more.  It's not, now in this country where the government is considering slashing the tariff to basically make community energy completely unviable, it's a total own goal, it's not just about the energy YouGen rate, community energy generates community, generates investment, generates sociable events, generates massive amounts, public health, we lose that really at our peril. \line \tab       Another thing is for me when I was teaching Permaculture Design we kind of designed all the benefits up to the boundaries of the site and not beyond that.  Actually, it feels to me like linking everything up is one of the things that we see happening in transition, this is in Luxembourg, Marco his here from Terra, a fantastic community-supported project there, it's part of a suite of other cooperatives that are being rolled out, energy Co-Op, a local food Co-Op, all of these things tie together in a way that's really, really important I think. \line \tab       Doing the unexpected, this the rise of community currencies, the transition currencies, there is now million pounds worth of transition currency in circulation.  This the Brixton pound who just produced this limited edition five pound note to celebrate their }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}fifth}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} birthday, designed by a Turner Prize winning artist, imagine if all our money looked like that, described as, "Wonderful invites for us all to step into a better future - invite", the Mayor of Bristol takes the salary in Bristol pounds, you can tax with them, spend them honesty buses, spend them to buy train tickets, you can use them to do something else I've forgotten about, all sort of things, it's fantastic, these ideas are really sort of going.  Minimising barriers to participation, Luigi Russell recently wrote a book called 'Everything gardens' one thing he identified that transition does picking up on your point there, minimising the barriers people picking them up, in Pasadena, one of the quotes was, "I can't believe that the guy who built the matters landing Rover just fixed my shaver!"  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} which I really liked.  People from Cal-Tec, just up the road, love on the weekend to }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:5001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}fix stuff.  The way it works, it doesn't cost anything, but sit in the chair and tell me a story. \line \tab       This his in Fishguard in Wales, so again about real needs, one of the things when we do Permaculture Design, what are the needs.  Actually, what we see in a lot of permaculture projects is a really interesting kind of going to, looking into the needs in a different way, too people need Borage, I'm not sure, I've planted a lot, I don't eat a lot of Borage, I\~have to say!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  This is in Fishguard, what they are doing there, they are collect up all the food waste in the town, food waste that would otherwise be thrown away and they run a cafe based on that food waste. \line T\tab They keep 600 kilos of food a year }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5951}{\*\bkmkend ldl5951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}out of landfill and save 21 tonnes of carbon a year, but again they\~are building community they are bringing people together creating conversation, all kinds of other spin offs and dealing with food poverty as well.  \line \tab       Putting care at the centre, it's one }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6001}{\*\bkmkend ldl6001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of the things that actually what is this stuff really about.  We started out talking about transition being a response to oil, a response to climate change, we don't talk it as being a response anymore.  We talk bit as being a movement of communities round the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6051}{\*\bkmkend ldl6051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}world re-imagining and rebuilding their place.  \line \tab       We don't need\~to\~do that response stuff anymore, because all of this stuff is so fantastic, you don't need to start out all the time be saying we do this in response to this, we did it }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6101}{\*\bkmkend ldl6101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}because it's fantastic and because as human beings, as communities, as people this meets our needs so much better than what is currently been put forward as solutions.  We don't need the response bit anymore.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  \line \tab       So this is a project in\~a town where I }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6151}{\*\bkmkend ldl6151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}lived call Totnes which is a really interesting look at evolution of transition, stepping back saying do we need to be putting our name all over everything, taking over a facilitating role, 60 different organisations in our town who provide care and through the austerity cuts }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6201}{\*\bkmkend ldl6201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we're seeing a really, really struggling.  Caring Town Totnes is about bringing them altogether, how can we do this in\~a different way as a centre of the local economy, so looking the local economy through the lens of care is a really fantastic next step I think.  Cultivating }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6251}{\*\bkmkend ldl6251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}entrepreneurship, one of\~the things when people look round permaculture, transition, they say well, often it's white, middle class people, well actually a lot of the time went over\~to America a couple of years ago, in Richmond and California I said it feels to me until }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6301}{\*\bkmkend ldl6301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we're able to create livelihoods for people that's really how it's going to be the idea everybody is able to give times as volunteers, there's a tyranny of volunteerism, because volunteerism tends to attract the people with time an energy to do\~it.  If we can start to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6351}{\*\bkmkend ldl6351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}create livelihoods for people then it starts to really change.  She said it's so brilliant to hear someone say that in my community this a revolution that depends on volunteers, I can't be part of this revolution nor can anyone where I live so putting central the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6401}{\*\bkmkend ldl6401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}idea that people need to p, creating livelihoods out of this is really central.  This is in Brixton, the first event called a local entrepreneur forum to run outside of Totnes, it's a fantastic event where you bring the community together, 4 or 5 people with ideas }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6451}{\*\bkmkend ldl6451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}for businesses, present their idea to the community, and invite the community support.  We say everybody is an investor, whether you can lend someone a pen, \'a310,000, let them put stuff in your shed, you\~are investing in\~the economy of that place.  It's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6501}{\*\bkmkend ldl6501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}fantastic I have never been to\~an event about business that moves people to tears.  This a reputable thing, this can happen anywhere.  \line \tab       One of\~the things that I designed into transition from\~the beginning has been the idea about going deeper, this not just an outer }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6551}{\*\bkmkend ldl6551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}process it's an inner process too.  People come on transition training and imagine they will get 2 days of how to start a community company, local currency, what they get is 2 days of how to keep a group together, how have a healthy culture in }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6601}{\*\bkmkend ldl6601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that.  This is a story from Portugal from a place, which a transition group so really fantastic story distribute how they came together they were doing stuff, they all start today fall out with each other, the group fell apart, and then there\~was a conscious decision }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6651}{\*\bkmkend ldl6651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to try and rebuild it again and learn from the mistakes that happened there to, put that idea of going and Sophie Banks who's a colleague of mine at transition network, says actually when you look at communities around the world that actually able to live and }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6701}{\*\bkmkend ldl6701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}survive over time it not just about going broader and broader it's also about going deeper.  Actually designing that deepening in from the beginning feels really, really important.  \line \tab       Working with partnership, this in Holland in place called (name) transition group came together }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6751}{\*\bkmkend ldl6751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}there with\~a local ecovillage project they worked together to build the first one, 5 million develop, straw bales, that kind of thing.  Stories lots of people have been talking about stories here, stories are so powerful, this is one of my favourite, every movement }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6801}{\*\bkmkend ldl6801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}needs its flags, its banners.  This is\~the Brixton \'a310 with David Bowie on it which I have held this up in talks, its\~got a round of applause without me see saying anything \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} I went to Paris a few months ago to a transition group there in suburbs of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6851}{\*\bkmkend ldl6851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Paris, this gentleman is\~the mayor, he came out there\uc1\u8217\'92s 120 transitioners there, great event going on there, beautiful community garden, he came along he wanted to have his photograph taken not with me not with the transition people, holding the \'a310 }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6901}{\*\bkmkend ldl6901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}note.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} Isn't that interesting, what is it about that he wanted to take back his world, what are the sticky stories.  So when we're doing transition work permaculture, I always invite people to think what's the story you can tell here the town }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6951}{\*\bkmkend ldl6951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that prints its own money.  We did a project in Totnes called Totnes the nut tree capital of Britain.  There's a real story in Totnes the nut capital of Britain which have long being assumed to be the case.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} re-skilling getting people together to learn }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7001}{\*\bkmkend ldl7001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}skills this in Brazil where 2 neighbourhoods, a favela in Sao Paulo, and I shouldn't say it because I have not got my notes, I more middle class suburb of the city, came together to look at rain water harvesting, the city is }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7051}{\*\bkmkend ldl7051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}going through an atrocious drought suffering from some people call hydrocollapse.  Dengue fever, all sorts of thing are going on.  They have come together to teach each other how to do rain water harvesting properly.  Transition streets have been a }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7101}{\*\bkmkend ldl7101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}way of getting people together on a street by street basis working together in\~order to save water and.  In the Totnes one 550 household did it on average they cut their carbon by 1.5 tonnes, the key thing they reported as a benefit was knowing }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7151}{\*\bkmkend ldl7151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}their neighbours, feeling part of a community the place where they live.  Looking at the past the present the future this in South\~Africa, a fantastic transition group there working with legacy of apartheid, dealing with current issues round hopelessness and skills in\~the context of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7201}{\*\bkmkend ldl7201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the future around climate change.  \line \tab       Work is often something where we don't get to bring all of ourselves to work, work only wants one bit of us.  How do we build work that we can do bring all of us to, ooh excuse me.  This }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7251}{\*\bkmkend ldl7251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is crystal palace a food market a fantastic project where they have created a new market that all sorts of people have been able to create livelihood because they have created the space and invited people to do that.  13 new businesses have now formed because they create the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7301}{\*\bkmkend ldl7301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}space and the invitation for people to do that.  For\~me in terms of stepping this stuff up the community scale one of the key things is bringing assets into community ownership, as communities when we own assets we are so much more in control of our destiny then we }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7351}{\*\bkmkend ldl7351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}were before.  This is Greenslade Farm near Wigan, and they have been doing phenomenal stuff there bringing this farm into community ownership as a care farm, providing care, all sorts of different stuff that's kicking off from that.  \line \tab       Bringing investment in, in different ways. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7401}{\*\bkmkend ldl7401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}How do we then resource is this in Belgium, this amazing project there the transition group did there a food belt round the city, reconnecting the city to the land round it, and looking at that as a way of generating massive amounts of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7451}{\*\bkmkend ldl7451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}work and employment and enterprise the first farms are already going in place, they are inviting the community to get behind that invest in it and enable it to happen.  Scaling this stuff up is\~the key challenge, and in Peterborough, in Canada, they }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7501}{\*\bkmkend ldl7501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}are really looking at that in terms of this sort of 25% shift around food, identifying the economic benefits that would generate.  We move beyond the idea of permaculture being some kind of a fringe thing to saying this stuff\~is a form of economic development.  This }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7551}{\*\bkmkend ldl7551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}stuff if we get it right is will create the jobs, what will create the new economies it's already beginning, we can look the see this stuff happening all over the place.  If we can, there\~is an economic case to be argued there but thus meets }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7601}{\*\bkmkend ldl7601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}are needs way, way better.  I don't want to leave you with the impression the bigger things are the more important, they are for\~me, one of\~the key things is that all the scales as important.  This is a lovely story in Brussels where a community in a }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7651}{\*\bkmkend ldl7651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}red light district where people were kerb-crawling up and down the street, people were coming out in\~the morning to take their kids to school, finding condoms in their doorways the council hats this idea they could block the street off in\~the middle so people could drive down }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7701}{\*\bkmkend ldl7701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the streets.  Actually the transition group said, why don't we make\~a garden instead.  So they built this garden out of waste timber, every 13 different residents have a patch, they say it's fun and the kids now play in\~the street this place has come back\~to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7751}{\*\bkmkend ldl7751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}life again, we have something to talk about each other again.  This stuff works on all different scales.  \line \tab       So transition is one of the things that I am presenting here in my diploma update \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} the other one I want\~to mention very briefly because I know we're }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7801}{\*\bkmkend ldl7801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}running over time is something I am involved with without my transition had on in my town in Totnes which is called Atmos.  It's an old milk factory that used\~to employ 165 people in\~the town used\~to take a tonne of clotted cream every }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7851}{\*\bkmkend ldl7851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}day, that's a\~lot of clotted cream, I think cardiac units of the south-west are still getting their heads around that one. \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} We have run a process for a community led development using a new government power here where you can if you engage lots of people you can }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7901}{\*\bkmkend ldl7901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}run a referendum as a route to planning it's if more than 50% of people who vote, vote in favour that's full planning permission.  We're doing this as a \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  community, this is\~the day that we were able to make the announcement to community that we signed an agreement }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7951}{\*\bkmkend ldl7951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}with the site's owners, this the design as it's coming along, 70-100% affordable houses built using local materials skills and training, new public space, edible landscaping, we have consulted 3500 people so\~far, in\~a town of 8500 it will be over }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8001}{\*\bkmkend ldl8001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}8,000.  There's something here \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  but in terms of informing this question of having come through permaculture for me one of the themes is, one of\~the key things about scaling up is we have to be able to step way, way out of our comfort zones.  All }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8051}{\*\bkmkend ldl8051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}too often we\~get we stay in our comfort zones because they\~are comfortable, funny that, but stepping outside of this is scary.  This is a really scary project to be, part of \uc1\u8211\'96 I\uc1\u8217\'92m one of 5 directors that are behind this scheme, every day we're step }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8101}{\*\bkmkend ldl8101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}out into the unknown, living with feeling deeply unnerved is part of the territory.  That is where the fruit is going out on the limb, that's where the fruit is.  Sometimes we fall out of the tree, sometimes we end up in the grass looking }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8151}{\*\bkmkend ldl8151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}down, amazing what you can learn looking into the grass after falling out of the tree.  Stepping out of our comfort zones is really central with this. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

Can I ask for compassionate brevity, one question, one out breath, no lecture please.  My first speaker is Graham Bell, he's been teaching permaculture since 1989, he's taught on four continents, he's, he was the editor of Permaculture News in the nineties, he's a, he's also been a member of the Permaculture Council, helping to develop the structure of the association in Britain which has created this amazing event, also the author of the Permaculture Way and the Permaculture Garden that we publish and are here.  He's been an instructor for the countryside premium screen, formally part of the agricultural training board and with his wife, Nancy, he probably has one of the oldest forest gardens in Britain that Geoff mentioned in his keynote.  So, welcome Graham Bell.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line GRAHAM BELL:  Good morning.  Just a little advertisement before I start, this morning Fayo, the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, published my short article on my blog if you like on soils, year of the soils, as an advert for this event, if you want to pick up the heart of what to say you will find it there later on. \line \tab       This talk is called 'The answer lies in the soil' in the 1960s when we had Sunday lunch afterwards, because television was a sort of kind of new thing to us poor people in Britain, we used to actually listen to the radio a lot.  There were a lot of very funny programmes, the Goon Show, the Navy Lark, things like that, this quote is from a guy called Kenneth Williams, no longer with us, he played a }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}character}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, Arthur Fallowfield, who gave the first gardening talks on the BBC Radio Home Service, what ever question he always started the answer with, "Ah, the answer lies in the soil", and it does! }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

The quote from Carol Capek, is particular relevant, I have to make an exception here, as we also heard this morning we can't actually live without water and air }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:6001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}either.  I should point out that all the photographs in the display apart from Kenneth Williams come from my garden, so if you want to know what my garden looks like you get little introduction here the differences of course, we can't live without water and air now, today, but long-term we can't live without soil. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

If you want to be on our mailing list, please do leave us your email address and we will add you on.  This is a pond in our garden, there are two ponds in our garden and there are some important things we need to understand about soil and I'm sure, I'm preaching to the converted when I run these by you: firstly, soil has a mineral fraction, made up of three things, clay, sand, silt, most of us are familiar with this.  There are also then living organisms in the soil and decaying organic matter from the life cycles of those living things having ended.  It's these things, together, that create the substance of soil.  Of course soil doesn't really work very well unless it's got holes in it, pore space, needed to accommodation air and water.  As I hope to show you today and I'm sure my colleagues will do following on from me in a slightly more slightly more scientific way, the important thing about soil is that it's alive, the key thing is 'Life'. \line \tab       We neglect soils at our peril.  This is a slightly misleading photograph, this is the Nagev Desert, which is a true desert as opposed to one we created.  This is very interesting, what's going on here, this is a field growing millet.  Berba Tribes people come through here before the rain and with the slightly updated technology of range Rover and plough, they plough up the waddy and then plant millet seed and when the rains come it's germinated, this is a desert with a rain fall of about 10 millimetres a year.  We are making deserts like this everyday in this world.  Iraq mentioned yesterday, the birth place of agricultural, you will have noticed it's now a desert.  Syria, a forest kingdom in historical memory, great productive soils, produced huge amounts of produce and sustained large populations.  Syria was a forest kingdom, most of it is desert now.  Libya and other parts of North Africa were the grain basket of Roman empire, where they grew wheat }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:6501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is now desert.  So we neglect soils at our peril. \line \tab       I don't know if you know about Gertrude Jekyll, it's per pertinent, it's 0.18 of hectare, but in our research we round up to one decimal place, I call it 0.1, that's one 5th an acre, for American friends in particular, who often don't think in metric, but it's not very big.  Two years ago this garden produced one metric ton of food.  That's ten tonnes a hectare.  For 20 years it took about two hours a week, now it takes about two days a week, we do it slightly more intensively, harvest our own rain water, produces our own firewood and produce 5,000 plants and 5,000 trees for sale in our nursery every year on 0.1 of a hectare.  This is an aerial photograph, Nancy, my wife and I, we live in the bungalow next to this rather grand block with a c tower, we have now completely rebuilt it and made it energy efficient and the garden you can't see any more, you will see why.  That's 1990, when we started, so blank canvass, just a flat field of weeds this is a castellated house was built in 1948 for a gillie, it's the Gaelic, word for servant, he was in charge of the fishing, since the man who bought the estate only brought it for the fishing, he built this house and was given it free for life, Mr Tailor lived to be 96, by which time the new owners of the house were outside bursting brown paper bags trying to get rid of him!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  At sometime they had }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}ground}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} potatoes, runner beans, he kept sheep dogs, a typical thing for a gillie to do, it was a blank canvass and not very fertile, not surprisingly, it had not been maintained as a walled garden as it originally was for about 25 years, so the fertility that had been there had largely gone. \line \tab       The photograph on the left was taken two years ago on an open day, that's by the garden wall on the left hand side.  You will see why I say you couldn't see the garden }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}today}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, all the trees are left than 25 years old.  The picture on the right is a sign we just put out on open days to welcome people, we are registered Scotland site and in fact there are still places, if anybody wants to come over the convergence on a Scotland tour and we start in our garden and visit }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:7001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}five other sites in Scotland, if anybody is interested do ask afterwards. \line \tab       It's my contention that anybody who grows anything is doing research, because if you don't learn from your mistakes you will carry on making the same mistakes and one of the easiest ways to learn how well you are doing is to measure what you do in some way.  The fact of the matter is actually worry about people, as Geoff was saying this morning, I really worry about people that don't make mistakes, if you are not making mistakes you are not trying to do anything new the important thing is not to keep making the same mistakes and preferably don't make any 'Terminal' mistakes, as I told my children many times!  I have a feeling myself that sometimes the lessons we have to learn in life take more than one mistake to learn, because that's why we are on the planet to learn those things.  However, we did research, we were privileged last year to have a survey done by somebody who's actually at the conference here, who was in his final year doing a degree at Edinburgh university in plant sciences, and he measured }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8352}{\*\bkmkend ldl8352}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}eight sites in Scotland which are noted for organic production, the results came back for seven, some reason why the eighth didn't appear it doesn't particularly matter, and there\~are 2 graphs here this bar chart shows you the levels of 5 particular nutrients in the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8401}{\*\bkmkend ldl8401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}soil.  Soluble nitrogen, insoluble nitrogen, potassium phosphorous and magnesium.  Notice the garden cottage is top.  Then the same side of figs for calcium.  The reason calcium is on a separate chart is much more prevalent in\~a bar chart, it doesn't work to put }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8451}{\*\bkmkend ldl8451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}them altogether.  Our garden came at top of\~the seven gardens in five of the categories, and second in two of them.  So one of the things you can see from\~the research is our garden produce us plenty of nutrient on the soil.  Mostly this comes from within }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8501}{\*\bkmkend ldl8501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the garden itself.  So the garden is largely self-fertile.  There\~are some minor exceptions to that, which I won't go\~into just now, but what we're doing is we're creating a system which is a complete cycle, a complete loop.  We make about 15 cubic metres of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8551}{\*\bkmkend ldl8551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}compost a year, we have all kinds of matter we return to garden and as you will see.  I am actually immensely grateful to this chap, he\~was doing humanity a great service he worked out the major nutrients in soil in }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8601}{\*\bkmkend ldl8601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}chemical terms were nitrogen, potassium, the reason why I say this might be a big lie is what we now know is many of\~the minor nutrients are as important as these.  So for\~example if you want to grow sweetcorn and you don't have many seeds you }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8651}{\*\bkmkend ldl8651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}want get any sweetcorn.  Energy efficient soils are about more than this.   \line \tab       What is really important is what makes all these things work, living processes again, just a throw\~away thought for you who likes marmite, who hates }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8701}{\*\bkmkend ldl8701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}it.  He also invented it, he got into\~the idea you could ferment the remains of brewing process, as a product.  There will\~be a marmite\~party afterwards.  \line \tab       Somebody said yesterday we have 226 species of, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8752}{\*\bkmkend ldl8752}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}sorry variety of tree in\~the garden, that's true some of them are for sale, they\~are them for sign wood because we do grafting we don't really need anymore apples.  These are the things we harvested last year roughly speaking.  You can see there's a }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8801}{\*\bkmkend ldl8801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}range of food product, a wide\~range of species a wide range of varieties.  We have over 60 species of plant you can pick a salad from about May through to November, if you think a salad is lettuce, tomatoes and cucumber.  You\~get an }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8851}{\*\bkmkend ldl8851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}immense mix of minerals, we're not using any chemicals at all in the garden I dent like to call\~it organic because legally in the UK you're not allowed to unless it's registered, but because we're somewhere streets beyond organic because this is an immense polyculture.  You }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8901}{\*\bkmkend ldl8901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}can be organic and just be a rotational monoculture, that's not the same thing at all.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  \line \tab       so here we are, this is yield by month, and what you notice is there's a huge peak between June and November.  So, storing food becomes }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8951}{\*\bkmkend ldl8951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}very\~important.  This is a breakdown on the metric tonne of food, 2 years ago.  It\~was down a bit last year because top fruit suffers from bi-annualism if you get very heavy yield one year it down the next year.  It's about 400 kilo }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9001}{\*\bkmkend ldl9001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}for this year we're only just starting\~to pick apples, we have got potatoes and carrots and parsnips to dig so lots more weight to come.  How do we do it?  No bare soil, anybody who's read Ruth Stout's books, she does it with hay. \uc1\u8216\'91Why would you }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9051}{\*\bkmkend ldl9051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}need horse manure because horse manure is just hay with the horse taken out.  If you use hay you\~get all of it.\uc1\u8217\'92  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} We use straw, lots of ground cover plants, leaf mould, anything that biodegradable that's organic.  These guys everybody knows that legumes }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9102}{\*\bkmkend ldl9102}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}fix nitrogen, there's no plant on the planet that fix nitrogen it's bacteria that do it they make little houses on their roots, you have got to understand about the living process on\~the soil if you really want to husband it well.  The other marvellous thing }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9151}{\*\bkmkend ldl9151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}about these guys they have higher protein in their pollen than anything else, if you think you have got bee problems get these guys in and the bees will have a wild time.  People ask us if we keep bees we don't we have got 20 species of bee that keep }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9201}{\*\bkmkend ldl9201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}themselves.  \line \tab       Anybody have ever feel like this?  Well I was disappointed in\~a couple of things yesterday, Jonathan Porritt doesn't understand that algae are people too.  We were talking yesterday about the lovely garden in Colorado how you can kill all the insects with foliar sprays. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9251}{\*\bkmkend ldl9251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}We try not to kill anything, if you don't have aphids you won't get blue tits.  The point is\~to have everything alive but in balance.  So I love this quote "bugs are not going inherit the earth, they own it. We might as well }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9301}{\*\bkmkend ldl9301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}make peace with the landlord". That's what we do all\~the time.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  \line \tab       We employ willing workers on organic farms we have a great\~deal, these guys as the thing was quote this morning, read Charles Darwin you will work out in our garden we have }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9351}{\*\bkmkend ldl9351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}2 tonnes of these you know\~the dump bags they deliver aggregate in off\~the back of\~a truck, about so big, those contain a tonne, so imagine 2 bags like that.  These guys don't stop for lunch they don't stop at weekend they don't take holidays they slow }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9401}{\*\bkmkend ldl9401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}down a bit in the winter you don't have to pay them and they feed themselves.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} I have got an intern coming in\~a week\uc1\u8217\'92s time, we use them rarely and all the other people in the soil that work with them.  Mycelium, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9452}{\*\bkmkend ldl9452}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}fungi are the most fantastic life system on the planet, 950 hectares, do you know how\~many blue whales you can fit in that, a\~lot.  These guys rule the world. Paul Stammett who I will quote at, talked about them as the next }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9501}{\*\bkmkend ldl9501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}information revolution because if we could just work out how to use hi-fi and mycelium we could probably all communicate with each\~other and throw away everything electric because they really do talk to each other, right across the planet and they are so important to life in the soil. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9551}{\*\bkmkend ldl9551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Ok.

She snuck in two. \line GRAHAM BELL:  She did worn you. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  I'm from the East of England, we have the rain level of probably Spain, I'm working on Sandy soil, I'm a good permaculturist, I\~do the right things, but I find the soil is so Sandy, that there aren't any, you know, the crevices in it, you know, it's really hard to actually---. \line GRAHAM BELL:  Where exactly are you. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  In Cambridge. \line GRAHAM BELL:  In Cambridge itself, you have the same rain as us 600 millimetres, although it's in Scotland, it's on the East Coast, you have more evaporation in summer than we do, it's warmer, not a lot warmer you have to keep adding to the soil, humus, get as much organic on it as\~you can, build soil crumb, soil structure, just keep building the soil, year on year, it will get better, talk to it nicely.  . \line MADDY HARLAND:  So moving ahead now, we're now going to invite Dr Chris Warburton Brown to the stage, the research co-ordinator of Britain, of permaculture in Britain, PhD from university, Antipoverty work, community development, history and archaeological archaeology teaching, beg your pardon, organic food retailing and farming.  He's married with two children, young daughters and lives in Newcastle upon Tyne.  Welcome, Chris.  . \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  Your whole life described in three sentences, yeah.  So I had a very varied career I find myself in a slightly dangerous place here, bridging between Graham and Joel Williams, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:8001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}who probably know more about soil than anyone in the place, I don't wand to offend anyone, I'm not an expert in soil, please bear that in mind in what I say, I feel quite daunted by the two giants that I'm going to try and build a bridge between in the next 20 minutes.  Most of what I'm going to talk about is the work the Permaculture Association has been doing around soil, or the research section of the Permaculture Association has been doing around soil over the last three years. \line \tab       So in late 2012 the association research team began to focus on soil and we got some funding from lush cosmetics who got a credit yesterday, they recurrently fund my job, get amazing credit for the work they fund, everyone buy some soap please.  This runs to Christmas 2014, as the output of that funding we publish the permaculture soil test handbook and the soil advice hadn't book, online, not physical published if you go to the Permaculture Association website and click on, "Research", on the top bar you will find this and its free for you all to use if you so wish, where ever you are in the world.  Although I did have a lovely email from somebody two weeks ago, working in Southern Africa, saying that really we need to put more work into developing the tests for the global south, I think that's right, those of you in the global south who would like to share in that work, please do, I guess tests, although it's attempting to be universal are primarily aimed at temperate areas, because that is where we tested them in the UK. \line \tab       So, why did we start with soil?  I started on this within three months of coming in to the post, why did we think soil was the right place to start in permaculture research?  Because everybody says, as we have heard again this morning, permaculture is good for the soil and using permaculture techniques will improve soil health.  Ok, great.  We're all up for this, we think permaculture is really good for soil, but how do we know that that's true.  How can we improve our own soil using permaculture, how do we know what we are doing works.  So the first thing that I started to ask when I came into the post was, what are the big claims that permaculture makes?  A and B, how do we know that any of these things are actually true?  So to meet soil and subsequently biodiversity is in obvious place to start, I think I can say hopefully without fear of contradiction everybody working on permaculture things soil and biodiversity are good things and we are doing good things for them, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:8501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}do\~you\~know in your own garden that what you are doing really benefits the soil? }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

So we establish some criteria for the tests we wanted to develop to help people find out whether what they were doing was good for }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}their}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} own soil.  These were a kind of key criteria our test must understand soil is a holistic system not a load of disconnected bits the }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}tes}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}t would need no specialist equipment no specialist knowledge, I suppose you could say permaculture is specialist knowledge but no specialist in department scientific knowledge, the }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}tests s}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}hould take no longer than two years, should give genuinely useful information about the soil and give actions to improve the soil further.  Well, I don't think this should be two difficulty, this looks quite straightforward to me, surely it's possible to create tools to help us understand our own soils without having a lab in our back garden or doing a module or degree in soil science, but actually it turned out to be rather more difficulty than we thought, we did find some really good, we started looking for international examples and we did find really good international examples which we incorporated into our tests, so it wasn't totally barren, but we really structured with the fact that soil science in general, this may be becoming less the case but for most of the last fifty years has been dominated by lab-based, lab testing.  A real focus on chemistry and very little on biology, I had a very leap forward when I met Professor Geoff Squire, from James Hutton Institute, there are some here, I met him at conference and we were talking about soil,-said, "Really soil has three legs, chemistry, biology and structure", really soil science for most of the last fifty years thought about one of the legs, a little about structure and a very little about biology, that's started to change.  Our understanding of soil has been done in umm... dominated as Graham touched on and Geoff as well this morning, by chemistry at the expense of structure and biology.  So we adopted what we call a 'Biostructural approach', Geoff Squires word, biostructural crisis of soil which underpins the problems that Geoff talked about and also Graham with the desertification of soils, this kind of crisis is, this biostructural crisis.  Soil science testing at the smallest part not the }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}whole}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, characterised by }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:9001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a strong emphasis on MPK and }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}nutrients}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} in soil, there were no even nationally agreed tense, intensity and PH are the ones people seem to think are established and we have included them in our tests we thought it was too small, just }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}given}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} two tests we thought was way too small, way too limited.  This quote which I found just sums it up really, this is apparently what soil testing is, it's a special chemical analysis that provides a guideline for lime and fertiliser needs in souls when considered in conjunction ...."  }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Y}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}ou all know, there is no point me trying to do tests, this is what it is, it has to go off to a lamb and a chemist has to look at it, I don't want to be too }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}harsh}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} it's useful to get your soil chemically analysed the idea that this is the whole of what soil testing is, I find problematic.  Here's my attempt - the purpose of these tests is to measure the quality of your soil, the tests focus on healthy soil, rich in microbial life and has a good structure.  That's my pitch at what a permaculture approach to soil might be, that quote I've tried to capture what I think, if we're going to test our soil from a permaculture perspective, this is what we are looking for. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

Our basic belief is that a well fed soil with beautifully cared for life and a good structure will generally feed plants very well, I'm not saying you shouldn't get your soil chemically tested, on the whole if you look thereafter solicitor it will look after the plants, feed the solicitor not the plant is a well established element of organic gardening, if you are growing carrots you will feed them rather differently than potatoes I want to add to that, designing good soil, what did Geoff say this morning, "Ethical design science", definition of permaculture, we need to ethically design our soil.  A design for good soil should be a key part of all permaculture projects, the answer lies in the soil. \line \tab       Good, so history a rich life ranging from bugs to forms and fungi, it's the rich life that creates the soil, it's the life that creates the soil, but much conventional farming practice ignores it, which maybe you can get away with, but much conventional practice is open }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} destructive of soil biology, I was in a farmer's field, having a look ready for this talk, I just dug my }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}heel}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} into }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:9501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the soil, could I find a worm in there?

"Recent research has revealed the true matter of organic matter.  The prevailing thought was it\~was composted dead stuff rotting, we now see that clearly there are bacterial and fungal remains\uc1\u8221\'94, the implication that building }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10301}{\*\bkmkend ldl10301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}soil organic matter sequestering carbon are dependent on the living part of\~the soil.  It's everything that comes to regenerating and sustaining healthy soil.  Soil is indeed living.  \line \tab       Some people have been saying this for about 70 years, science it really establishing clearly that soil is }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10351}{\*\bkmkend ldl10351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}alive, I living thing, it's true supporting and building that life we can support healthy soil.  \line \tab       Now, I didn't\~know how to pitch this whether to pitch it in\~a really scientific or basic way I could have gone into much more in the revolution that\uc1\u8217\'92s taking }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10401}{\*\bkmkend ldl10401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}place in\~the literature that\uc1\u8217\'92s been produced on soil, I am not going to do that. I will just refer to two articles I found that came out at the start of this year.  Earthworms for Cropping Systems: A\~Review, anyone who doesn't know Agronomy}{\*\bkmkstart ldl10451}{\*\bkmkend ldl10451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} for Sustainable Development it's the most amazing journal even if you don't have access to it, you can get access to abstracts online I guarantee there won't be an issue that goes by you don't find something exciting and informative in there. It runs in France which I like, the French }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10501}{\*\bkmkend ldl10501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Agriculture Institute, they have got a really strong organic bio, you know, ecological agriculture programme.  give useful a few hours if you are like me you\~get on\~the internet you find one link, it takes you somewhere else then it takes you somewhere else, agronomy sustainable }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10551}{\*\bkmkend ldl10551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}you can go back then years and find all this amazing stuff, really good guidance about what we're doing in permaculture and some new things we can do in permaculture.  This wonderful article, Earthworms for Cropping Services. What do earthworms do for }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10601}{\*\bkmkend ldl10601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}our soil?  They improve soil structural stability, nutrient cycling in an extraordinary way. What is most amazing to me a really new discovery, worms induce the production of hormone like substance for plant growth.  Not only are they looking after making soil they\~are looking }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10651}{\*\bkmkend ldl10651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}after you soil, it's like medicine for the plants you are growing in that soil.  Graham has already said how amazing worms are in terms of their physical action on\~the soil, but also pretty amazing in\~the way they support what you\~are growing in non-physical or non-mechanical }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10701}{\*\bkmkend ldl10701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}ways.  \line \tab       Direct drilling of soil can increase worm abundance, organic amendments help worm abundance we knew all this already in permaculture, except perhaps the one about the hormones, here it is absolutely no question a review of all science know about earthworms, here what }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10751}{\*\bkmkend ldl10751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we have said in permaculture for years about worms, absolutely unquestionably true, up there for you.  Why we should love our worms, right there.  \line \tab       One other article.  This is based, on they claim it's the most in depth study of\~a single }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10801}{\*\bkmkend ldl10801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}site looking at the affect of conservation, agriculture and organic farming that ever been done, I don't\~know if that\uc1\u8217\'92s true or\~not, Graham might claim he's got an older one but this is you know a university supported scientific test site.  What do they discover }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10851}{\*\bkmkend ldl10851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}after 14 years of comparative system between conventional, conservation agriculture and organic farming what did they find?  They looked at the long-term events conservation and compare them, the affects are pretty extraordinary, conservation organic farming boost soil life nematodes increase up to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10901}{\*\bkmkend ldl10901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}seven times and microorganisms has a substantial affect on as well.  These are massive differences between a conventional soil and they found the conservation management is\~the most effective system.  \line \tab       So what does that look like in the long-term? No tillage systems, and the things }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10951}{\*\bkmkend ldl10951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}already mentioned by Graham are the best thing for soil, better even than using legume manures, much better than pesticide and mineral fertilisers. I maybe preaching to the converted here there it is in absolute black and white what we're doing in permaculture is exactly what }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11001}{\*\bkmkend ldl11001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we should be doing if we want to have healthy living soil.  \line \tab       Soil biology it's immensely important, it's the most complicated living system we know about, Joel will hopefully shed some light on that and give us more understanding of\~that I don't plan to understand }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11051}{\*\bkmkend ldl11051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that at all, we don't need to understand it.  Once you get a start looking at soil you very quickly discover that just by looking at soil smelling, it feeling soil, living soil looks very, very different to dead soil.  We don't need a lab or microscope }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11101}{\*\bkmkend ldl11101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to tell you that, you will very quickly see that begins to understand just by looking at soil how rich and alive it is.  We use very simple text proxy measure of\~the entire soil biology.  Earthworm count and how many earthworms have you got there, you reflect }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11151}{\*\bkmkend ldl11151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a massive amount of life in the soil the second is\~the displacements test you put it in water, you look at it after\~an hour, just in\~a glass beaker how\~much of it has fallen apart, come back after 24 hours, how much of it }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11201}{\*\bkmkend ldl11201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}has fallen apart.  The more organic life there\~is the soil the longer that ball will hold together in the water.  If I took the farmer soil looked at on Sunday I would have to spit on it because it\~was so dry, roll it into a ball stick it in my class }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11251}{\*\bkmkend ldl11251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}within a few minutes it would all fall apart, there\uc1\u8217\'92s no organic life holding it together.  If I took Graham\uc1\u8217\'92s soil and did the same\~thing we have to test it one day graham it would last for a long, long time before that soil eventual falls into the water. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11301}{\*\bkmkend ldl11301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}  That's the dispersal test, it shows you how well tied together the soil is by the humus that's in it.  \line \tab       Our little friends again, we share we should form a fan club the earthworm north-east of England/south-east of Scotland earthworm fan club, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11351}{\*\bkmkend ldl11351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we should establish tireless worker for humanity.  we also looked at structure in our test, healthy soil needs to have a good pore structure, air and water allowing roots and soil and life to wriggle through, also need a good crumb structure, balls of soil that }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11401}{\*\bkmkend ldl11401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}hold together, but not too hard, they can be crumpled apart.  That's what good soil looks like if we look down the microscope, nice big pores, lots of gaps between them.  The test we use in filtration, how quickly does water pass into }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11451}{\*\bkmkend ldl11451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the soil if go is too quickly or too slowly it's not great, we want soil that drains moderately slowly that good crumb structure.  Soil texture, feeling its ball density you can read that in the soil test, visual dispersal, these are all test you }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11501}{\*\bkmkend ldl11501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}can do in your own home with basic equipment, give you some idea of the structure of your soil.  We also do soil pH test because that is pretty critical for what you can grow, deliver things will grow in different pH, I guess }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11551}{\*\bkmkend ldl11551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}you know that already.  Soil depth, we're trying to build deeper and deeper soils, if you\~are up in\~the North Pennines or mountains of Colorado as we were hearing about yesterday, you have probably got pretty thin soil you might have a foot down into the bedrock.  Whenever }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11602}{\*\bkmkend ldl11602}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}you are you should be finding your soil is gradually getting deeper, as you as feeding it your soil should be piling up on your bedrock.  If you're me you have\~got about 2.5 foot or good soil down to\~the sub clay, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11652}{\*\bkmkend ldl11652}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the under clay.  I have added at least 6 inches on top of that in the last 10 years in my garden.  \line \tab  We look at water logging, we look at anaerobic - I guess I am running out of time.  Yes go for your soil chemistry }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11701}{\*\bkmkend ldl11701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}test that's fine, not against that but you do need\~to\~find nutrients shortages.  However central to a permaculture approach to soil is\~the holistic approach to soil, it means that detailed soil chemistry or nutrient analysis should only be one part of an integrated rounded approach to soil }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11751}{\*\bkmkend ldl11751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}health, to soil feeding to understanding soil biology and understanding soil structure.   Alongside the tested hand book we produce the permaculture soil advice booklet, I guess that anyone who's an experienced permaculturist will\~be doing the thing in there but it might be worth a list.  We }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11802}{\*\bkmkend ldl11802}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}suggest if you want to see the development of your soil over time you can repeat the test yearly hopefully it will show what you are doing it working, where's the lady with nettles, hopefully if you start to work on your soil it's starting\~to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11851}{\*\bkmkend ldl11851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}change and deepen, although you have got lots of nettles it might be good already.  Time invested is always time well spent. I am great enthusiastic of getting out and handling soil, we hope that eventually we can create a database of our results to show the benefits we're achieving.  \line \tab So there it is, our little friend the soil waiting to give you a hug.

I was in\~a similar situation when\~I took my garden on I can say personally what we have done, we have a garden that was not cultivated for 40 years, just keep dig it double dig it if }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12251}{\*\bkmkend ldl12251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}you can, then don't dig it anymore after that, and stick loads of organic matter keep going back to organic matter, keep putting.  The answer is always to feed the soil.  There's loads of good advice you can\~get I wouldn't want to put myself here }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12301}{\*\bkmkend ldl12301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}as someone who will advise you of all the things if you real the soil advice handbook it will tell you to too things\~to improve the structure, the biology the worms will come.  \line From The Floor:\tab Will that get rid of\~the poison? \line CHRIS WARBURTON-BROWN: Yeah it will, over time it will decay }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12351}{\*\bkmkend ldl12351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}slowly.  \line MADDY HARLAND: Do you want\~to take questions from that gentleman over there?  \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab  Maybe this is not for you, Geoff Lawton and others keep talking about it about the SOC, the soil organic carbon that\uc1\u8217\'92s a lot of carbon that's now in the soil not }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12401}{\*\bkmkend ldl12401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in the atmosphere, is there going to be a talk or more emphasis on how\~much good environmental work we're doing by building soil in\~a climate and carbon sense? \line CHRIS WARBURTON-BROWN: Great question the answer is very simple, the research is absolutely conclusive, it\uc1\u8217\'92s been much better }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12451}{\*\bkmkend ldl12451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}publicised in the research, building soil stores carbon.  The question really is how far are we interested in how\~much carbon we're storing? To me I am not very interested in that, I know that by building soil we\uc1\u8217\'92re having a substantial affect on sequestrating carbon.  If someone wants }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12501}{\*\bkmkend ldl12501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to do some research in permaculture, how\~much carbon we think we're storing that would be a fantastic research project for\~me. It goes back to some of things that were said this morning by Cathy Debenham, for\~me it's enough to know what I am getting out of this. One }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12551}{\*\bkmkend ldl12551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of\~the things I\uc1\u8217\'92m getting out of it by building soil, it's good for carbon.  Other people - I, we, I should have publicised the permaculture research digest, I'm always putting stuff on the blog, always on the permaculture research journal, articles that deal with this kind of stuff.  If anyone has got some email them to me I'll put them straight up on the digest, the research is out there, it's really good, it goes beyond where I want to be and where most permaculturists want to be, put it out there. \line MADDY HARLAND:  Thank you very much Chris.  Graham pointed out I didn't actually introduce myself I'm Maddy Harland, I'm actually founded Permanent Publications and Chair of the board of trustees that sustainability centre in Hampshire and a founder of Gaia education and few low of the royal society of arts, that's enough, but it's why I'm bossy!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  I'd like to welcome Joel Williams next to the stage.  He spent three years working for the soil food web in the UK, training and consulting with farmers on soil biology.  He has an in depth knowledge of soil biology and has been told his presentation's pitch soil biology in a very easy to understand, practical and from a real-world viewpoint.  On a practical level he's implementing biological principals on the farm in both intensive horticulture systems and in agricultural systems as well.  Welcome to Joel Williams now. \line JOEL WILLIAMS:  Ok, good afternoon.  We are going to take a pretty quick whistle stop tour through the world of soil biology, perhaps a quick apology to the lovely typewriter ladies I might go a little bit fast, for any of the non-English native speakers, if I am going too fast please give me a signal and I shall try and slow down.  What is a healthy soil?  We have touched on this now, the stool with three legs or I like to use my soil health triangle, it is a balance between the soil chemistry, the soil physics and the soil biology.  No\~one is more important than the other, they are all of equal importance and they very much influence each other when we change the biology we can change the soil's chemical and physical properties they work as one interchangeable and interconnected system. \line \tab       This is my take-home message, soil health is a balance between all three, every time we make a management decision }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:10001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in our farms, in our gardens we must ask ourselves what are the implications of the management decision on all three facets of soil health. \line \tab       Ok, where am I pointing here... there we go.  Ok.  What drives that healthy soil.  If we represent that soil health triangle perhaps the same but in a different way, what is the catalyst, what is at the centre of those three facets and we touched on this already, the soil organic matter, it's the fuel of this system, it's where the three worlds meet in the centre and as both Chris and Graham touched on it's where we should also be focusing our energy in terms of our efforts in terms of soil management. \line \tab       So what drives that organic carbon, how do we build humus in the soil, it's the microbes in the soil, it's the life in the soil and that's what we are going to jump in and discuss now.  They are the key ingredient that helps us to build humus, to improve that soil organic carbon to make the whole system work efficiently. \line \tab       Ok.  So how do we feed soil microbes?  With carbon.  Carbon feeds soil microbes and they help to build carbon, it's one of the positive feedback loops we have touched on in the course of the last two days already, they work in tandem, we feed microbes, we build humus, the more we feed humus the more resilience we build in the soil so microbes can thrive in that soil. \line \tab       Beneath the soil there is a huge community of life, vastly diverse community that live in the soil, fungi, protozoa, nematodes, earthworms, these are all the organisms that live in the soil beneath our feet and come together in this community that we call the soil food web. \line \tab       Now this is a nice, we probably many of you have seen this picture, a nice diagram of this underground world of life and at the bottom of this food web is the food sources, is the carbon is this organic matter, this the sources of energy that then feeds the, that flows upwards and feeds the life in the soil.  They need this carbon, this organic matter down here at the bottom and nutrients then flow upwards through this system.  That bottom here we have two very important groups that we will zone in and discuss today, bacteria and fungi, they are the primary decomposers, their primary role is to incorporate that food in to the living into the soil food web so the carbon can flow upwards into this living system, their role is really important.  We will come back to these guys, up to the bacteria and fungi we have up here the predators, organisms that eat other }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:10501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}organisms, primarily, some of these do feed on carbon too, but these are organisms that eat other organisms for their nourishment and nutrition.  We will come back to this chart as we flow along now, another one to sneak in there is algae, often people will talk about biology and start with bacteria and fungi.  Algae are microscopic }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}plants}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, an important contributors to the base of the food, maybe they photosynthesise, breath in C02 and exude those out into the soil for the bacteria and the fungi to feed on, they are also important contributors to the, as plant life to feeding the soil food web. \line \tab       So we jump to bacteria first, what do bacteria do in soil, they are a microscopic single celled organisms what they lack in size they make up in numbers, vast numbers of bacteria in a single tea spoon of soul, their role is to feed on that matter, to decompose the carbon the food sources coming into the system.  Bacteria grow then in colonies or they can be quite free living they put substances into the soil environment, many are quite sticky and start to glue soil particles together, little micro aggregates that the bacteria glue soil particles together, forming aggregates the structure we touched on already.  This is what the bacteria do in the soil, we also have a very huge number of bacteria in the soil, but only a small percentage is only ever active or live or feeding in the slide here you can see some glowing bacteria, we used a stain here, }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the alive -}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} the feeding bacteria have absorbed that, they glow and these are the active bacteria.  In the rest of the slide, all the rest here, dormant inactive bacteria, this would be 10% or so in soils, the microbes that are active at any one time, ball park.  This huge diversity of dormant organisms also are very, very important, because soils are hugely dynamic ecosystems, they fluctuate on an hourly basis on a daily basis on a monthly, season basis, temperature extremes, moisture extremes soils are diverse and dynamic, we have a huge - this is why we have vastness of life in soil, it is a harsh world to live in the dormant organisms as the soil moisture content changes they go to sleep and go dormant and all the dormant ones will wake up and fill that niche so we can have that constant cycle of life working in the soil.  So they are feeding on organic matter, then fungi, they are multi-celled organisms, go in long strands or threads called hyphae, similarly they are feeding }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:11001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}on that carbon and putting out waste products, gluey sticky products in to the soil, the physical growth habit the way that the strands and threads grow into the soil means that they have a very big influence on the structure of the soil, they physically change the structure of the soil as these hyphae grow through the soil, this is a very, very important that we will return to, here is a picture of them feeding on the organic matter, again releasing substances as they grow through the soil we talk about bacteria, these grow through and pull micro aggregates together into larger macro aggregates, when we have macro aggregates and aggregated structured soil in between there we have pore space and this is where we have oxygen, this is where our moisture can move through the soil, two very, very important nutrients, not nutrients, factors in soil health. \line \tab       We can probably stand here and talk a whole day and talk about \uc1\u8211\'96 microryzal fungi, they are a special type of fungi that works with a the plant, they colonise the plant system, these fungi are not primary decomposers, they don't as\~much feed on the humus, they }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}feed}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} on the plant, the plant breathes in the C02, sugars and carbs the fungi grows into the soil and accesses moisture and nutrients and puts it's back to the plant. \line \tab       Depending we know that microryzal fungi can increase the plants access of the soil volume.  What are the implications of that for our irrigation, our water requirements, nutrient requirements when the soil is, when the plans are accessing such greater soil volume.  Then we have our predators, the high level predators, they are single cell animals, primary role is to eat bacteria, when they eat bacteria like all organisms, they eat, consume, metabolise and excrete waste products, they are cycled back in to the system for plants to take up, withdraw those nutrients for their mineral nutrition. \line \tab       Then we also have our nematodes, most, I think Growers and farmers are well aware of the root feeding nematode, the plant parasitic nematodes that cause damage to the crops, there are a far greater number of beneficials, we just don't hear too many of those.  Here we have the root feeding or plant parasitic nematode, it has the spear-like structure here, that projects out of its mouth, punctures the plant root systems and fits on that route system ultimately causing rot and decay in that system.  We have the other beneficial nematodes as well that eat bacteria.  They have fine hairs at their mouth that }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:11501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}help to scoop in and eat bacteria.  Nematodes feed fungi they have a straw-like structure to feed on the hyphae, we have nematodes that at others, they are great biocontrol agents to encourage more predatory nematodes that consume our plant parasitic nematodes, as\~they eat the bacteria, fungi or other nematodes again, again they metabolise and extreme waste products that's how the plant feeds itself and accesses the nutrients in natural ecosystems. \line              So we have our soil insects, their primary role is\~to shred organic matter, to physically break down organic matter into smaller particle sizes so the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12601}{\*\bkmkend ldl12601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}bacteria and fungi can then start to do their decomposition.  Earthworms again similar, breaking physically breaking down organic matter, redistributing that matter down into depth creating the lovely channels and pores and structure we see here in this lovely picture.  Of\~course creating }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12651}{\*\bkmkend ldl12651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}channels for moisture and oxygen.  A really could example of this interface of biology and physics, biology changing the physical structure of the soil.  \line \tab       All of these organisms we have other animals going up beyond there, all of these come together in this wonderful }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12701}{\*\bkmkend ldl12701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}ecosystem called the soil food web and how these things all interact and eat each other and work synergistically with each other.  This is how I touched on these nutrients these are recycled and made available, every time a protozoa eats a bacteria it spits out the waste products which }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12751}{\*\bkmkend ldl12751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the plant can absorbed this how plants get their nutrients, nutrients are released.  Now if we look at soil chemistry we won't go into any great detail, but if we look at soil analysis or look at the nutrients that exist in the soils, they exist in }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12801}{\*\bkmkend ldl12801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}3 different forms.  Some of the nutrients that exist in soils are highly soluble and available, they are cycled on a very short-term hourly, daily basis.  These are the soluble forms, but we also have more medium term supply of nutrients, these are }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12851}{\*\bkmkend ldl12851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}called exchangeable, these are released a bit slower over time.  Then we have a total pool of nutrients, these are insoluble unavailable to the plan, over time thee nutrients move this way down into the soluble pool for the plant to take up. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12901}{\*\bkmkend ldl12901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}The key, the catalyst for cycling nutrients and accessing nutrients in mineral reserves in the soil is\~the interaction we have just discussed that bring nutrients in\~a very unavailable form down into an available form for the plant to take up.  \line \tab  Now, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12952}{\*\bkmkend ldl12952}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}one of\~the big criticisms of soil chemistry analysis is that\~it often just looks here if the nutrient is deficient here, be it any of them macro or micro, if it's deficient here we might say well there's not enough soluble nutrients in the soil we better put a }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13001}{\*\bkmkend ldl13001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}bag of fertiliser on, more nutrient on.  Well actually more of that nutrient but it's just up here.  There's even more of that nutrient but it's up here.  We don't necessarily need more fertiliser, we need more biological activity to bring the nutrients down into }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13051}{\*\bkmkend ldl13051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the available form.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  \line \tab So we're going to zoom now quickly into building humus carbon sequestration.  As they breathe they send those down to\~the root system and they exude these out of the root system to feed the life in\~the soil, to feed the organisms }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13102}{\*\bkmkend ldl13102}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in the soil we often hour the figure, the 30% of the net energy it captures it will exude out of the root system, can be anywhere of 5 up\~to 80% at times.  Plants exude sugars out into the soil they give away their energy, this is }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13151}{\*\bkmkend ldl13151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}not a loss or waste for the plant it's an investment.  It's feeding the biology because it's knows that it can access that, those nutrients and bring those back for the plant \line \tab So, depending on the soil biology in\~the soil that balance of organisms }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13201}{\*\bkmkend ldl13201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and how biologically active are those exudates, they leak out of the root system have the potential to be captured and stored in the soil.  The role of bacteria and fungi are very\~important in this equation.  Our current understanding suggests that fungi are much more important }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13251}{\*\bkmkend ldl13251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}than bacteria to sequester carbon and build humus, they store more carbon in their long hyphal threads, they store more carbon in their bodies.  Their by products, waste products are fungi feed they exude these waste products, they are larger chain }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13301}{\*\bkmkend ldl13301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}carbon compounds, more bigger chain carbon which is more resistant to degradation, they are larger than bacterial by products which break down more easy.  Fungal hyphae promotes soil through this physical habit of the fungal hyphae, this a nice way to illustrate this. Here we have }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13351}{\*\bkmkend ldl13351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}soil in\~a dispersed state, high oxygen can access there, we can see oxidation of our carbon back up into the atmosphere as CO}{\s31\f0\fs24\sub\lang2057{\*\listtag0}2}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}.  If\~we have picture of some fungi hyphae, growing up to part also releasing the gluey substance, sticking the structure together, to form }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13401}{\*\bkmkend ldl13401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}this nice soil aggregate, remember this is a 3D structure, this is a ball a sphere, within that ball now all of the organic matter and carbon within that aggregate is physically protected from oxygen and oxygenation.  So it can be broken down and lost back }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13451}{\*\bkmkend ldl13451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}as CO}{\s31\f0\fs24\sub\lang2057{\*\listtag0}2}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}.  So in aggregated soils we have physically protected that carbon and sequester that carbon rather than losing that soil.  Here we have a nice picture of some compost, some fungal hyphae again, structure is in motion right here, look }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13501}{\*\bkmkend ldl13501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}at the fungi strands here and you can see here and look at the dark spaces, the black pore spaces, look at the structure there that we see in this picture.  Here we are creating space for these aggregates and it's these perfectly structured aggregates that are }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13551}{\*\bkmkend ldl13551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the site of protection of carbon and maximum carbon sequestration and synthesis and protection of that carbon within those aggregates.  \line \tab       So this is I guess another one of my final take home messages, when we think about bacteria and fungi in our soils, follow this chart }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13601}{\*\bkmkend ldl13601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}with me, carbon inputs these root exudates, I mention exuding by the plant, compost manures.  The food source coming into this system will be fed on by either bacteria or fungi or a balance of both.  If we have dominance of bacteria in }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13651}{\*\bkmkend ldl13651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the soil they eat the table first, they gobble up all\~the carbon and it flows into this direction into the bacterial biomass.  As they feed on that company they breathe and we lose a bit of CO}{\s31\f0\fs24\sub\lang2057{\*\listtag0}2}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, but their by-products waste products are smaller therefore }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13701}{\*\bkmkend ldl13701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}less stable in the soil more easily further broken down by other organisms or lost back as CO}{\s31\f0\fs24\sub\lang2057{\*\listtag0}2}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}.  If\~we\~have more fungi in our soils and they eat at the table first that will flow down, when fungi feed do their thing in\~the soil they respire and }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13751}{\*\bkmkend ldl13751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}breathe as well but their waste products are larger chain and more stable and when we produce more stable larger chain carbon compounds they remain in\~the soil.  This leads to greater humus production, storage in the soil.  Now the reason I say this is that yes we }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13801}{\*\bkmkend ldl13801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}want to balance of all of these organisms but in our disturbed agriculture soils they are very bacterial dominated.  So\~if you disturb your soil all\~the time yet you\~are doing all\~the good things feeding it, putting all\~the compost in, all of that effort if bacteria are eating most of that }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13851}{\*\bkmkend ldl13851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}this your end point.  If you\~get more fungi in the soil this is your end point.  \line \tab       So a final quote to a nice kind of link to some of Chris's comments earlier, I will just read you this, one of my favourites to summarise it "The }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13901}{\*\bkmkend ldl13901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}achievement of sustainable agriculture was let down in the 20th century when research focused strongly on soil chemical and physical factors and neglected the biological factors" yes I have touched on soil biology today, it's a crucial catalyst ingredient in the mix but soil chemistry and physics }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13951}{\*\bkmkend ldl13951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}are also of create importance so always consider all three, but yes our research is now catching up in the world of soil biology.  Thank you very\~much, let's open to some questions.  If you like some more information I am doing some one-day courses, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl14001}{\*\bkmkend ldl14001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}one in Worcestershire and London, if you can come and see me, or find the website doing a one day course all about this stuff.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab  I got your flyers here for those courses.  \line JOEL WILLIAMS: Thank you.  This lady here.  \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab So }{\*\bkmkstart ldl14051}{\*\bkmkend ldl14051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}my question was related\~to how do you actually increase the fungi, and related to non-temperate India so perhaps reference to that, so basically how do we do that?  \line JOEL WILLIAMS: There's only so much we can do in 20 minutes.  The comment }{\*\bkmkstart ldl14101}{\*\bkmkend ldl14101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}have been touched on we need\~to\~feed the organisms it's about similarly fungi exudes more complex carbon chains which are stable they also like\~to feed on more complex carbon forms, we need to feed them the right types of carbon they like\~to feed on, they }{\*\bkmkstart ldl14151}{\*\bkmkend ldl14151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}will then sequester.  So fungi prefer dry wood material, things like woodchip things with wide or high carbon to nitrogen ratio.  This is why we see fungi in are forest ecosystems feeding on\~the logs }{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}et cetera}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}.  They don't love forms of carbon that are very small }{\*\bkmkstart ldl14201}{\*\bkmkend ldl14201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}like sugars and fresh green leaf material yes they will feed on those too, but they prefer try more carbon material, that's what they will feed on and exude.  That will be part of\~the answer.

Ok, good morning.  The introduction explained a lot, my name is Christopher Nesbitt, I live in Belize.  We're going to be talking today about damaged landscapes which... you can do that as you see, thank you. \line \tab       We're going to be talking about damaged landscapes which abound in low land humid tropics much of what I'm going to talk about will apply to that, but can apply elsewhere, Belize is in Central America, one of the only English speaking countries in the South America and Central America, the other one be Guyana, we have the Queen on the money, governor general, a real kinship to England, it's really nice to be here. \line \tab       I run a small NGO, Maya mountain research farm, located in the foothills of the Maya Mountains, I originally bought the farm in 1988, kind of immigration dodge, the easy was to move to Belize and call yourself a farmer my father gave me a book age ten, I read it, father rues the day he\~gave that to me, the agricultural life style applied to me, we are a registered }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:12001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}non-governmental organisation, we have 26 acres of land under some form of conservation and 500 species.  You can see here this is a Google map image of where we are, we are in kind of the edge of primal rainforest extending north for many, many miles, we occupy a very strategic place, there is a laser thing... }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

You can see a little bit further up from where it says Maya mountain research farm the river winds round, that's the sources of the river for much of the year, we occupy a strategic place in the landscape all of the water comes out of the grand close to where we are, we take our stewardship of where we are very closely.  We live in an area very beautiful, biologically important, the only way in and out is canoe, we have no roads, right here you can see what a traffic jam in San Pedro looks like, some days coming up the river is magical, wonderful thing, the closed I can get to meditation very peaceful, other days not so much.  This was the biggest flood on record, which on the 20, it will be 27 years in December that I've lived there.  We had the biggest flood ever, significantly about four or five feet above any other flood I've seen, also in the middle after that of the longest drought ever, we are seeing a lot of }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}global}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} change tied to that.  Paradoxically, if we can go back one... ok... this is... back then... ok, this is our the cycle of disturbance to soil, you can see in the previous picture, we don't have to go back to - \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} - there is a lot of nutrients being washed out, that's a benefit to us, we are accumulating soil it's the dry season garden we are not the first people to be here, we I have in an area densely populated during the Maya classic period, we are close to a Maya site.  We can learn a lot of things from them, they made all the right decisions for a while until they made the wrong decisions.  We don't have a lot of time to go into that, but we are going to talk about what are degraded lands.  All of the developing world suffers from a lot of degraded land, much of this tied to population density, some of it is tied to politics and economics, so to define it we're looking at things like forward cattle Pasteur where the land is not fallow or rotated, former citrus groves a lot of that in Belize, former banana plantation, slash and burn that has not been fallowed, we need }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:12501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a five year fallow cycle to repair the soil.  Export land, fire damaged landscapes and we see accelerated poverty type soil depletion, the soil gets depleted, people start to make more advances in to the forest to grow things. \line \tab       Where are we now?  Population density is directly tied to soil depletion.  So, I'm just going to go through numbers very quickly, 1985 when I arrived in Belize age 19, population 150,000 people.  In 2014 we had 330,000 people.  In Guatemala population, the same period, 6m people, to 14m people.  The adjacent department of Guatemala, the Preten, in 1985 150,000 people, after the be accord signed in 1996, the displaced refugees that couldn't come back to their land all moved to the Preten there are 2m people there, we see complete collapse of soil.  In a 30 year period, more or less, in 1980 Belize had 74.4% forest cover, in 201062.8%, in 201460.3% forest coverage, not only are we getting more forest loss, the rate of loss is increasing, all tied to population density and bad agricultural practices. \line \tab       This is just some depressing pictures of two periods of 30 years apart, of soil loss or forest cover loss.  Now we are going to look at some of the enemies, slash and burn is one of the problems that we have.  I live in a Maya community, all the adjacent villages are }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Maya}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, San Pedro Columbia is the large population - slash and burn works really well, it's a perfect system.  As\~long\~as your population remains static.  What we are seeing now is there are consequences of slash and burn, escaped fires, some farmers I was working with 15 years ago, refugees from Honduras and El Salvador, who settled in Belize in the eighties, in the nineties I was working with them.  There was a fire that escaped about two miles away, it churned through the forest about a week and then killed all their crops, one of the saddest things I ever saw. \line \tab       This is a picture of a hill side colonised by illegal }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}squatters}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, making bad decisions, they are cannibalising, stealing from the future to maintain the present, they have cleared into land that is marginal for agricultural at best, certainly for grain agriculture it's not suitable, }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}one}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} crop out of }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:13001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}this and then the soil is gone, when the soil is gone you can't farm out of this.  All the ecosystems it provides are compromised the hills across the road behind this, also suffer this, that's an escaped fire that erased all by fire, it supports forest that provides the ecosystems services we will cover later.  Mara mountain research farm, installed a PV system on the school and built the water system, I'll }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}mention}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} that energy poverty ties into soil poverty. \line \tab       What we are looking at is how do we repair these things.  What we are looking for is to create a Forest of Food crops and timber crops, medicinal crops and market crops, we need to use pioneer species, you put it and it will give you a yield in a year or two, at the same time providing services to the soil, we are going to run through a few of these, pineapple is a useful food, planted on contour, it can control erosion, this is a very important food in India, is a excellent food sources it is also a semi-perennial, it puts down a deep tap root injecting the soil with a lot of carbon microryzal bacteria that help fix nitrogen, it helps to control erosion, this breaks up the soil, it's a semi-perennial leaf plant very important, there is papaya also, it helps to break and pollinate, it's a }{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}legumes}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, it's a highly abbreviated thing, list, excuse me. \line \tab       2004, when we started Maya mountain research farm I'd been living in the land for many years and I wanted to start a project, I managed it on behalf of UK based company call green and blacks, makes very good chocolate, what we found was the best way to convey information to farmers who's literacy levels are small, low rather excuse me and in terms of reading and writing but their visual, their literacy is highly visual, was through actually site visits.  So I set up Maya mountain research farm as a venue to provide training for farmers so they can come and see best practice. \line \tab       So we will look at changes, in 2006 when we got funding for the classroom, this was the view out of the win de, the same view in 2013, from up on the roof above that window, from that window, }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}again}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} this is the view in 2015. \line \tab       This is a piece of }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}land}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} that got damaged in a fire in 2008 - \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} - thank you.  This is a fire that got damaged in, a piece of land that got damaged }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:13501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}by fire in 2008, in 2013 we colonised, we pushed the bush back to reduce the fire risk to our structures and putting in some pineapple this is what it looked like later in the year with some bananas, later in the year with more bananas, this is what it looked like a year later and is what it looks like two years later, already getting banana and pineapple, both the pineapple is retaining solicitor and the bananas help to break up the soil, it doesn't change the structure but breaks up the structure.  There is ginger and our eventual food forest, this is also a land that got damaged by the fire in 2008.  In 2006, this is the building on the left is something we call the posh pods, where we put the big times, two floor condominium, it's not really, then a building called the dorm.  This is what it looks like in 2013, excuse me... wait, I went too far... ok.  Thank you.  2008, this is what it looked like after the fire around the building called the classroom, we nearly lost that, we planted bananas and pine apples, we used an A-frame level.  In 20014, you can't see the classroom, it's behind all those trees, oops, sorry, going the other way.  Sorry.  This is also another view around the classroom in 2014 where we planted a lot of planting to put the fire risk back and to provide seed.  We are not the first people to live here in the area north of us in the Maya mountains there is many terraces, this is actually on the other side of the Maya Mountains in the water shed, they are agricultural terraces, mechanical barriers to retain soil, which allowed, along with probably agroforestry and a bunch of other things for them to get extremely high population density and to achieve enough surplus to float religious, trade, soldiers, artisans, all things that make up a great tradition, we do a little terracing too, terraces are not as big.  Then we use things like the mascarenhas mulching method, does anyone know him?  He's one of my students, he was working on his permaculture diploma and in turned with us to make a piggery, he started making contraptions that I ended up calling the mascarenhas mulching method, biomass in an open V facing up the }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:14001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}slope and then you fill biomass in it, a lot of banana stems, it's a byproduct of harvesting.  It acts as a silt trap so as the water washes silt in, the network of plant material and biomass there slows it down and increases fungal activity around the root zone of the target species, in this case a bread nut tree.  }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

But what we're looking at is repairing damaged land, creating conditions we can put cacao.

Then when we're done it grows back again.

Yes }{\*\bkmkstart ldl15902}{\*\bkmkend ldl15902}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}please.  \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab We have got a field which is on a high moorland in the Pennines, it\~was cattle pasture now it's a traditional hay meadow but it's got a\~lot of reeds growing on it, how do I get rid of\~the reed? It's about 10 }{\*\bkmkstart ldl15951}{\*\bkmkend ldl15951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}acres.  \line GRAHAM BELL: Why do you want to get rid of\~the weeds?  Oh reeds! It's an indication the soil is wet and acid, you need to open it up, what's the underlying geology \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab  Grit stone, I know\~the real answer is drainage that's an expensive answer.  \line GRAHAM BELL: Moles are }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16001}{\*\bkmkend ldl16001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}quite good at providing free field grain and moles need earthworms so gentle liming. If you keep sheep on it if you need\~to\~restore minerals tied up by the liming.  The other thing you can do is rip it with a plough, just to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16051}{\*\bkmkend ldl16051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}create drains.  As much as you would do key liming, it depends how shallow the soil is.  \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab There's a reasonable depth but moles don't like wet ground either.  Graham, if you rip it with a mole plough it creates drainage and introduce earthworms and lime.  \line MADDY HARLAND: Thank you graham any other questions?  Yes please.  \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab  How do you use the bio char?  \line CHRISTOPHER NESBITT: Bio char, one of\~the people I work with is Albert Bates who wrote a book called the bio char solution it explains a\~lot about }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16151}{\*\bkmkend ldl16151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}it. I was initially a sceptic then I was reading about it, it started to make sense.  Bio char is maximising edge, one gram of charcoal spread into one flat surface with 2 sides covers enough space to cover a basketball court.  If we add that directly }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16201}{\*\bkmkend ldl16201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to soil, you would see an immediate loss of soil would move into colonise that space, we mixed it with our compost and one of the things we do is unfortunately I have got about 50% through the thing, slide but we would like\~to cook, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16251}{\*\bkmkend ldl16251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we have a bio char stove we use to cook our pig food, some of the hard nuts we have then we feed that to pigs, the bio char we put in their bedding, then we put that in the compost that is one of reasons that our cacao }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16301}{\*\bkmkend ldl16301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}trees are appearing in three years.  I was initially sceptic about it, I'm a huge believer in it. The one year we did trials we did hundred cacao trees with it they are now appearing in less than three years and we did 20 control trees, we got hit }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16351}{\*\bkmkend ldl16351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}by a very, very pronounced snap of dry and rainy season, all 20 of\~the trees died, the ones the controls with no bio char, all\~the others survived.  That's how we use it.  \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab  Thank you.  \line MADDY HARLAND: This gentleman up there for a bit of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16401}{\*\bkmkend ldl16401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}exercise, meet halfway.  \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab  How do you quantify the sequestration of carbon so you can use it for carbon off setting? \line JOEL WILLIAMS: There\~are many different ways of measure carbon, these are the joys of testing, hundred techniques and methodologies they all have different interpretations and }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16451}{\*\bkmkend ldl16451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}numbers.  Quite a minefield.  One of\~the important things is consistency it's not necessarily a soil test number in itself it's that number over time, trends and patterns over time is what becomes much more important than an individual number.  There's a\~lot of discussion round that I guess }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16501}{\*\bkmkend ldl16501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that question regarding what, should there be a universal methodology for testing carbon for this purpose, the answer is not agreed upon.  There\~are lots of different ways.  Of\~course then there's the other question of course there's a\~lot of interest carbon off setting and farmers getting paid to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16551}{\*\bkmkend ldl16551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}build carbon in the soil. This is of great interest particularly\~in Australia, there\uc1\u8217\'92s so much debate about how you actually do some of\~the nuts and bolts, how you do that.   Yes it's hopefully coming but exactly how and when it's still in\~the making. \line MADDY HARLAND: Compassionate }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16601}{\*\bkmkend ldl16601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to our tummies now I am going to pull this to a close.  \line CHRIS WARBURTON-BROWN: Can I get a quick plug in, research digest, }{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Permaculture Research Digest}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, get on their and search it. \line MADDY HARLAND: I have been asked also to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16651}{\*\bkmkend ldl16651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}give a little plug for a another not for profit project called Soil Hack if you put\~a that into your browsers, you will find useful resource's plans for webinars, affordable real life events, a collaborative process you are all invited, that's the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16701}{\*\bkmkend ldl16701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Irish in me, to get involved so please put your together and thank these 4 gentleman for their fantastic presentations today \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  \line MADDY HARLAND: Can I just put a plug in for the permaculture convergence where we will be talking more about forest gardening and more about soil and in more detail because }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16751}{\*\bkmkend ldl16751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we haven\uc1\u8217\'92t\~got anymore time thank you very\~much.}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

So we are starting now for the afternoon session, about farming system design.  So, I'm really happy to welcome you at this presentation I'm Kevin Morel from France, an permaculture engineer, I'm doing my PhD at the French national Institute for Agriculture in France and I'm working on the viability of rediversified organic market gardens and including permaculture farms. \line \tab       So today we are going to have a presentation from three speakers, only two of them have arrived yet so I'm hoping that the third one will come, if not we will have more time to discuss and have fun together, so it's perfect. \line \tab       So, to start Naomi will present to us practical examples of diversified farming systems in Nepal and the UK and share with us innovative ideas for designing resilient farming systems.  I also think she will raise questions about practical and socio-economics challenges and opportunities for such initiatives. \line \tab       When you are designing innovative systems it's essential and challenging to be able to assess and measure the impact of what you are doing, that's the reason why in the second time and Immo will present such initiatives.

So my name is Dr Naomi van der Velden, I\~have two-part time jobs which, I work as lecturer in ecology and sustainability in Cumbria in the far North-West of England and the next big step project in the Permaculture Association in Britain. \line \tab       So, I hadn't exactly anticipated that I would be talking in farming systems so I have modified my talk a little bit.  One of the things that I realised is that farmers, anyone growing food, have to know as\~much stuff about such a variety of things that there is a huge hand overwhelming amount of information out there, too much for any one person to absorb all the knowledge from. \line \tab       So, I\~have tried to take some of that knowledge and present some of the evidence for what I'm really going to be talking about.  My }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:14502"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}research interests are in plant communities and that's gone from looking at forest ecosystems to mountain ecosystems, to giving me more time to pursue my passion, which was gardening and growing food.  So, to looking at food producing plant communities.  So we understand that there are many benefits from what we might call 'Multispecies' or 'Polyculture' food growing systems, growing more than one species in the same area.  This is just a summary from a review paper that shows some of those benefits, so impacts, enhancing biodiversity, soil and water conservation, pest regulation which obviously links into economics and money-saving and also linked to greater overall productivity in natural systems.  We have very few studies looking at food producing systems, as a scientist it's very complex to understand all the interrelating factors, soon as you have more than two crop species it becomes more difficult to understand, what the result because of this or that or because of interaction, we have a bit of a lack of methodology for understanding these systems at a scientific level. \line \tab       So sorry... so multispecies systems are used a lot around the world, mostly used in what we might call family scale subsistence production, largely in the global south and in the tropics.  Agro forestry systems are using these systems have emerged from the tropics, we saw a }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}couple}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} of presentations about forest gardens yesterday and some diverse mixes in temperate systems as well.  Of course in the traditional home or cottage garden in Europe we would have had quite diverse species mixes, it tends to be people growing for their family and they want to grow a diversity of things. \line \tab       Ok.  There's been relatively little commercial production using these systems, I'm kind of curious, given all of these benefits, why and we using these systems more?  I couldn't really find out any research about the barriers to use, but talking to people and I've kind of thought about it, these are some of the suggestions.  So, monoculture involves, often big investments in machinery, so there is mechanisation, machinery is often focused on producing one kind of crop and can't be transferred to a different kind of crop.  It does require a lot of knowledge and expertise to be able to understand how best to grow crops, which mixtures grow best together, how you can plant during a time and then plant another one over a season or over a year.  For larger scale farmers which can be quite small scale large farmers, there is also a risk in trying new stuff.  They are often operating on very small profit margins so trying to invest in something else is perhaps a risky proposition, you want to know that something is }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:15001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}going to work before switching to a different kind of system. \line \tab       There is always the opportunity cost, but what I think the real answer is, that it's a question of scale.  So, at what scale do these systems work and how can we best use them. \line \tab       So, I just want to go through and look at some of the evidence around this now.  So we know that there are approximately 570m farms around the world, of those 84% are small farms, less than 2 hectares.  The larger farms tend to be in South America and in higher income countries.  We see that a lot of the research and design investment is geared towards those larger farms and towards looking at technological innovations that suit this kind of larger scale mechanised production. \line \tab       So, interestingly, despite the fact that they have 84% of the farms on only 12% of the land, they are proportionally more productive.  The graph is showing in green how much of a proportion small farms are in different countries and in red what the proportion of the land is.  So you can see in all these cases in this list, looking at the smallest 75% of farms in each country, in each case productivity is higher proportion compared to the land area, overall these are more productive.  We have evidence that polycultures can lead 20 - 60 percent more than monocultures.  }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sb100\sa100\s31\sl360\slmult1\itap0{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch So, interestingly smaller farmers but not surprisingly at all, smaller farmers tend to grow a different variety of crops but also a different variety of cultivars that different types of\~the same crop, often what's called land razors those that have a history }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16851}{\*\bkmkend ldl16851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and a heritage from that area maybe from trading seeds, saving seeds swapping seeds rather than buying in the formal modern variety of seed.  \line \tab       This has been shown to offer much more harvest security if some individuals die, others will survive and different ones in }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16901}{\*\bkmkend ldl16901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}different years.  One example in Peru, farmers are growing 50 different varieties of potatoes and at higher altitude, different varieties of potatoes were being grown.  A particularly cold year or hot year will the cold winds coming up from the arctic gum that allows }{\*\bkmkstart ldl16951}{\*\bkmkend ldl16951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}for variety, you know you will get some of it produced.  In contrast looking at some of the main crops grown round the world this study is showing in for each crop so in the top left maize underneath is wheat, then top right rice, underneath is }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17001}{\*\bkmkend ldl17001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}soil.  Red is showing susceptibility to climate change the yield on the growing condition will be adverse, and yield will be improved.  Particularly for wheat and maize they are very vulnerable to climate change.  Rice in some areas it will do ok, in some areas it }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17051}{\*\bkmkend ldl17051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}will do badly but overall that's balanced and the same for soil, there's an overall balance on those two.  We know our current systems are not terribly resilient or biodiversity, they are not giving us the services and cultural benefits we need\~to\~have I just wanted\~to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17101}{\*\bkmkend ldl17101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}present some of that evidence for those claims.  \line \tab       So, there's been a\~lot of innovation in farming recently, so last year was the year of the small farmers, family farmers and there's been a\~lot of interesting work done.  There's the organic movement that's looking at }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17151}{\*\bkmkend ldl17151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}growing different kinds of ways, much more focused on environmental protection biodiversity, there's satellite farming where the farmer is basically farming with a laptop in the tractor that telling him or her all\~the details about their land, so it might be how dry or wet }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17201}{\*\bkmkend ldl17201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the soil is across an area or what your nutrient status across an area but they are very expensive systems.  \line \tab       There\~are some very interesting emerging local satellite or precision farming systems, a nice one emerging in Africa, I am currently involved in\~a project that hopefully }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17251}{\*\bkmkend ldl17251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}makes something similar\~to this start happening in Europe but at the moment, they are quite prohibitively expensive.  What it allows you to do is to fertilise your land just where it's needed.  So you prevent run off, and unwanted things.  For\~example, so it allows }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17301}{\*\bkmkend ldl17301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}you to have a really fine control over the inputs to your land.  There's also a\~lot of work about integrated agriculture, so these are all kind of things that feed into systems and understanding, but also exist separately to those, so integrated agriculture you have }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17351}{\*\bkmkend ldl17351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}probably heard many of\~the concepts but really about looking at where your inputs and outputs so and recycling and reusing those.  There's a whole body and evidence of literature growing round these systems as well.  \line \tab       There's also at the same time, a huge wave }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17401}{\*\bkmkend ldl17401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of innovation in home scale systems, so looking at\~vertical growing, aquaponic systems, rooftop growing using and reclaiming new space that's not designated for agriculture but can be used in that way I am sure you have all seen some amazing inspiring examples of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17451}{\*\bkmkend ldl17451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}this type of different growing.  There's a huge wave of change and innovation both from commercial right through to family levels.  \line \tab       Couple of years ago, 2011 I was involved in\~a mix cropping trail we want\~to test a low and high diversity mix of species so in our }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17501}{\*\bkmkend ldl17501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}low species mix there\~is just 3 species, peas, radish and spinach.  In the high diversity mix, there\~are those 3 species plus those others.  So a total of 12 different crops.  We sent seeds out\~to 50 households along with growing instructions and we }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17551}{\*\bkmkend ldl17551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}got data back from 26 of those.  We asked them to measure the harvest every time they harvested anyone of the crops and all at the quality of\~it, did you eat all of\~it some of it or none of\~it.  \line \tab       This is a kind of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17601}{\*\bkmkend ldl17601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}map of those results.  From the low mixture on the left, and the high mixture on\~the right, looking from yellow means fairly low yield and through to red is a higher yield.  Those are kilograms per metre squared.  The north of Britain tends }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17651}{\*\bkmkend ldl17651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to be harsher for arable growing still had some high productivity.  What really interesting about this is looking at the total yields were square metre, average yield equates to 35 tonnes per hectare.  The maximum yield was over hundred tonnes per hectare.  That compares to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17701}{\*\bkmkend ldl17701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}UK field vegetable table trials in the same year of 19 tonnes per hectare, the only other evidence of family growing was from 1948, dig for Britain, lots of people growing food to support their families of 16 tonnes per hectare.  I know there\~are }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17751}{\*\bkmkend ldl17751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}questions about scale, damaging one metre square to a thousand metre square is a hugely different thing, but having households doing a 2 metre squared, potentially there could be a\~lot of production.  I scaled this up with some simple sums, I hope.  216 }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17803}{\*\bkmkend ldl17803}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}million households in Europe approximately, there\~was a study this year that suggested round about 15% of households grow their own food.  So\~if that 15%, 324,000 household grew 10 by 10 metre plot, then they could produce over million tonnes of food. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17851}{\*\bkmkend ldl17851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Sounds like quite a\~lot.  The interesting thing about this is\~the other benefits that come with that.  So our participants don't see food growing as a job they see it as a leisure activity, enjoyment as well as producing food.  If all households grew that then }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17901}{\*\bkmkend ldl17901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}potentially 75.6 million tonnes of food could be grown in Europe just in households, not all households have that land, some have more or less, but European Union can see however we worked it there\~is interesting potential there.  It's not going\~to grow all of out }{\*\bkmkstart ldl17951}{\*\bkmkend ldl17951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}food.  In 2014 I could only\~get data for three crops they together same to 25.8 million tonnes.  \line \tab       So, that's a potential.  We can do some stuff.  Having lots of people doing a small amount of food production is going to make }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18001}{\*\bkmkend ldl18001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a big impact that could be equivalent to or meeting the kind of European production of vegetables.  \line \tab       So I just want\~to shift now to looking at some work I was doing just speaking with people in Nepal.  I am going to bring it into looking at permaculture. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18051}{\*\bkmkend ldl18051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\line \tab       So, of the people I spoke to in a high mountain area of Nepal, most families have round a half hectare plot, that tends to feed about 5 people plus a assorted livestock.  They tend to grow their own feed and grow typically oranges, honey, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18102}{\*\bkmkend ldl18102}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and then buy that other products that they need and are unable to grow at this altitude.  \line \tab       What I saw Chris Evans who is I am sure here or will be at the Convergence, he's been working in this area for 20 years, and his }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18151}{\*\bkmkend ldl18151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}influence was incredible so having somebody training in permaculture then training people to train other people in permaculture, has had a huge and significant impact to these people's lives.  So the key things that\~I noticed in terms of what they were doing differently or what they }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18201}{\*\bkmkend ldl18201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}told me they were doing differently was using manure, definitely not chemicals which were expensive but also really heavy to bring up to the mountain side it's about a seven hour walk.  Store feeding animals, cutting forage, bringing it back to animals so they }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18251}{\*\bkmkend ldl18251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}weren't in the forest or degrading the soils, and there\~was less than the problem of over grazing, and improve the forest there.  \line \tab       Other things included toilet facilities using biogas, and overall a longer period over which crops were being produced because }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18301}{\*\bkmkend ldl18301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of greater diversity of crops were being growing.  \line \tab       The permaculture gave support to new growing techniques, to allowing people to learn by doing things, by trying them out, and then being able to train others.  It also more than how\~much food you could grow }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18351}{\*\bkmkend ldl18351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}over what kind of food you could grow, it changed, it seemed\~to me to change how people think about it, and perhaps you all feel the same that permaculture is not about growing food it's about so much more.

For }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18401}{\*\bkmkend ldl18401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}anyone who has experience of working in cultures like Nepal, this is one of my favourite quotes from my farmer "I am educating my daughter-in-law."  To educate your daughter is quite nice, but also to invest in your son's wives is a huge cultural thing, so }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18451}{\*\bkmkend ldl18451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}seeing the role of women and empowering women to be part of this system has been a really important slowly transformational change there.  \line \tab       They also spoke about health improvements, income generation opportunities and it cost less because they were learning how to do things based on }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18501}{\*\bkmkend ldl18501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}nature and the land, and also there\~was definitely a sense that those who had learned and trained has permaculture educators were very\~much respected in their communities, they held good position, very\~much respected, other people would bring their problems and issues to them.  \line \tab       So }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18552}{\*\bkmkend ldl18552}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in summary then, I see permaculture differing to those other innovations, I have kind of skipped over those because I have only got 20 minutes I am probably already over.  In its flexibility, it's not saying you must do this then you must do that and }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18601}{\*\bkmkend ldl18601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that if you don't meet this, we're not going\~to certify you or we're not going to approve you.

I wanted originally to compare in Nepal people who are doing permaculture with people who are not, I couldn't find people not doing permaculture, even when I went far away from the place it's transitioning through, "Oh I don't too permaculture", but you are hanging up your garlic in the barn roof, "Oh yeah, I do that", all the techniques coming through, they don't have the whole design system but they do have the techniques. \line \tab       So the last thing I'm going to say, it supports a life style change and perhaps that's more important than just looking at what can be more productive or more biodiversity.

Really it's building a community around a farm seems really important to be able to bring in all those skills.  So that was, sort of, the thing that really came up for me there.

I guess that part of what am trying to say, that permaculture provides that empowering kind of community, but yeah, thank you for putting it much more eloquently than I did.  So, yeah, I think one of the reasons that the Nepal project has been so successful, it has had one incredibly motivated and well-educated person there for a really long time.  So rather than being in an aid project that's there for maybe two or three years, he's actually been there for a really long time.  You can see how that long-term investment which is what permaculture is about, has really benefited those communities.  Yeah, learning from each other as well.  . \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Hi, I'd just like to ask a question, ask something about, you know, in terms of scaling up particularly.  Over, certainly my observation offer the UK there has been a big collapse in family farms.  Is the impact of things like land prices, tax systems and the subsidy regime on promoting the kind of agricultural change that you are talking about. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

I\~have spoken to people from many countries that have issues with land tenure, being able to access land, but being able to build in the way they want to build, being able to grow in the way they want to grow, so, yeah, I think that this is part of that complexity that farmers, Growers have to deal with, but we are also seeing some positive examples of legislative change.  I know Rod, who just asked a question, managed to persuade Lancashire council, all new houses should be echo built, is that right, so self-sufficient, sustainable, there is opportunity to start to influence these things.  There is huge resurgence in popularity of food growing in Britain is starting to link back into some of those land uses.  At least at local government levels.  In my own town in Penrith, the council have become incredibly open to community gardening and using spaces and freeing up land spaces, I feel like it has been a barrier, but with this kind of movement and this interest and people that are able to influence policy makers as well to make the changes to see it's viable and the approaches are important, I think it's changing, it's currently very difficult, but it is changing.  It's changing both at grass-roots level but also from higher EU level so there is a big push at EU level to look at family farming and there have been a lot of reports recently saying, actually we need to invest in these small farms because they have in that diversity of crops they have resilience in food producing, they have resilience in the economics of the farm, that if one crop fails of doesn't get bought by the shops they still have some back up things, there does seem be an increasing rate of support for appreciating these smaller scale systems.  At the same time it's also really complex, lots of eastern European countries joining to the EU, are having to change their farming systems to meet with the regulations over the size, colour and quantity of their crops can be, so it could go both ways and maybe we are at a point where we can help push it the way we want to go. \line KEVIN MOREL:  Thank you very much, any - I'm sorry, we need to switch - ok, one more, but really short and short answer as well. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Someone from the online community, would it ever be, become too threatening to introduce new species and biodiversity, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:16502"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}or too much species?  . }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

There are risks, I was just speaking to somebody in the break in the Netherlands who is saying that she is growing a permaculture farm but her seeds are spreading to the local farmers who are monocultures and they have complained that they don't want to see that, so she has been asked to move of her rented land.  So, yes, it can be and we need to think of some ways and solutions to manage that. \line KEVIN MOREL:  Thank you very much, for large-scale farmers who want to switch to the large-scale complex systems, it's another way of thinking, as we say at the beginning, sometimes the knowledge you need to implement the complex systems can be really overwhelming, so we need to develop practical tools to be able to understand and to implement the systems and to implement them we need to, to accept them and to see how they can have impacts on production but also on other aspects of social life, networks and everything.

First my thanks go to Coventry University and the centre of agro ecology, water and resilience who made this study possible.  I'm part of the study, my thanks Tomas Remiarz Ulrich, Julia and Pierre.  I'm going to introduce myself.  Then I'm going to talk a little bit about research, connected to a farm.  Finally, I'm going to talk about the findings. \line \tab       So that's me, Mexico is where I grew up as an adolescent and that's where this environmental story for me really started, because I got to travel a lot and I saw the beauty of the country, but also I saw what rampant treatment by humans was doing to it, with lots of erosion damage.  I, I felt very story for that and at that time I didn't know that this could become a profession to try and remediate that. \line \tab       So first I went in to the natural sciences and from there, in my profession, into healthcare where, amongst other things, I dealt with very umm... very constrained studies, clinical studies where it is all about double-blind controlled studies which is something that now, hopefully, will }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:17001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}help me as\~well.  I also realised that in healthcare, popping pills is not necessarily making humans healthy.  So during my work as an editorial services I wrote some things about environmental issues and that's how I got to know about permaculture.  That was in 2008, I met Sep and permaculture and I got a certificate with him on his farm.  At the end of it I said I want to go back into research and look at the evidence behind the claims.  Now I've got stuck - sorry, point it up here towards me \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Sean}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0} speaking from the gallery}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

So this is how my journey started and how I got infected by the permaculture virus. \line \tab       As I mentioned, this is Sepp Holzer you saw pictures of his farm earlier on, he's a man who fights, who is very strong, to get is ideas through.

So putting it in a picture, it's about lively hoods and a farm like this, a }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}market}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} like this one which is very lively in Barcelona and largely selling produce from conventional farming and I would like to see permaculture products on there instead. \line \tab       So, the question is: how can we confirm transform commercial farming systems with conventional, certified organic or biodynamic to permaculture systems and monitor the change and sustainability as well as resilience during that process.  Again how does that translate to livelihoods, that means eventually to money. \line \tab      \tab       Well }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18702}{\*\bkmkend ldl18702}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}also what I am interested is to see what impact does the building of water retention spaces do on the land, which is one of Sepp Holzer's speciality, but also other permaculturist, it's another building site it's very invasive, what's the worth of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18751}{\*\bkmkend ldl18751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}it.  I think it's pretty obvious, but how can you put that into figures that are convincing.  \line \tab       Now my next question was when I started this research project in April this year, what is a useful research tool to do this.  What are }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18801}{\*\bkmkend ldl18801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}meaningful parameters, and how can I measure that.  It's about measuring sustainability it's about measuring resilience.  I did an extensive literature search I have written it I am not going\~to read it out just to give you an idea it's quite complex, there's a\~lot of literature }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18851}{\*\bkmkend ldl18851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}written on sustainability assessment tools there\~are a\~lot of reviews, so I have to plough through all of this, at the end of this I came up with something that seemed quite good to me.  I have chosen a tool that would be about sustainability that would measure }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18901}{\*\bkmkend ldl18901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}sustainability along the food and agriculture value chains.  That was you know, important not assess something else.  I want\~it\~to be holistic so it needs to be a global framework.  It need to be universal for small medium and large-scale companies or enterprises and also it }{\*\bkmkstart ldl18951}{\*\bkmkend ldl18951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}needed to be relevant to government strategies policy and planning, my idea is to build a bridge from grass roots up\~to yep policy making on a country level or a continent level or world level.  \line \tab       Yeah the last idea was this should allow for self assessment so }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19001}{\*\bkmkend ldl19001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that everybody can do it.  \line \tab       So what I came up with is\~the SAFA tool the Sustainability Assessment tool of Food and Agriculture systems.  It's freely available, by FAO, it has 4 dimensions, important for\~me environmental integrity, economic resilience, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19052}{\*\bkmkend ldl19052}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}social wellbeing, map with earth care, people care and fair share.  \line \tab       Just\~to give you an idea it's 21 themes that it covers, those are divided in 58 sub themes, and 116 indicators so it's about 116 }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19101}{\*\bkmkend ldl19101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}different questions, the whole tool works as an interview kind of, yeah you talk with the farmer or the farmer talks with himself.  Just to give you an idea what in indicator looks like, this is\~the indicator called ecosystem enhancing practices, e 4.1.2, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19154}{\*\bkmkend ldl19154}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}what I liked about the SAFA tool is a\~lot of the indicators do cover topics that are also topics in permaculture.  In this case it\~was about agroforestry, mixed rice-fish systems, interperennial, forest garden, all these }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19201}{\*\bkmkend ldl19201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}topics are there they are important at FAO level already.  They have developed a tool to assess that.  \line \tab       This is just to give you an idea what is a data entry screen looks like it's just an example for the topic of soil organic }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19251}{\*\bkmkend ldl19251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}matter and for the farm I am going to present in the next slide I can say already that most of that at least the way I assessed it, was in this very good or very good region.  \line \tab       So this is what the result can look }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19301}{\*\bkmkend ldl19301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}like, this is just an example.  The actual result from the farm you will see later.  You see all the themes that are covered in this sort of polygon plot.  \line \tab       This is\~the farm I went to visit, I stayed there for 2 weeks, as you }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19351}{\*\bkmkend ldl19351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}can already 10 minutes, great yeah should be possible it's a Demeter farm it's also certified organic, really convinced that permaculture is\~the way to go forward.  Just to give you an idea where it is it is in Spain in the Huelva province in the south }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19401}{\*\bkmkend ldl19401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}where all\~the strawberries come from you probably know, but this is here not about strawberries.  So it's also not far from Gibraltar which many of you will probably know.  The region is very dry with most rainfall in winter.  They have\~an average rainfall of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19451}{\*\bkmkend ldl19451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}470 mm, and having said that it has dropped a\~lot now, it has dropped by 1 quarter within the last years.  \line \tab       Yeah main produce is fruit so fruit trees and we're talking about 50 hectares.  \line \tab       The farm is owned by a }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19501}{\*\bkmkend ldl19501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}German person, Mr Lehman, he's also a owner of\~a big company a wholesaling company for organic produce based in\~Germany, he owns this farm and a few others so the wholesaling company is like a holding and it's one of the largest importers of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19551}{\*\bkmkend ldl19551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}organic produce in Europe.  So thanks to Mr Lehman, I was able to assess this farm.  These pictures are just what is around that farm, it's olives and on naked earth, and I just happen to see that sign there.  So we want\~to move from the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19601}{\*\bkmkend ldl19601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}left hand side to the right hand side which is also olives, on Jelanisol and Montebello which is\~the name of the farm or 2 farms put together, that's the variety of crops they have.  I am not going to go into it in detail.  That covers }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19651}{\*\bkmkend ldl19651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the topic of biodiversity, there's a\~lot different ones, there\~are also some there experimenting with, there\~is also some crops they just have for the staff to eat which is also nice from the social perspective.  \line \tab       Yeah, topography, now we have to say moving from }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19701}{\*\bkmkend ldl19701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}biodynamic organic certified to permaculture, it's not starting from scratch, so we have a farm that also, that's already running and productive, and during the transition to permaculture to a permaculture system it needs to continue being productive.  So this keyline design, is }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19751}{\*\bkmkend ldl19751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}one part of the farm that where trees were grown so they could take this chance to do it in keyline design and grow new trees.  It's taken from a drone, that\uc1\u8217\'92s what it looks like, lichee and pomegranate mixed.  These were straight lines before }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19801}{\*\bkmkend ldl19801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and it\~was important to break the wind tunnel because there's a\~lot of hot wind from Sahara, so what was done was quite clever, by moving one tree from here to there, closing that tunnel, and still being able to go through the rows and harvest it. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19851}{\*\bkmkend ldl19851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\line \tab       This is\~the water bit, water retention space that was built there, the draw back is that actually rainfall dropped a\~lot, and that's why it's reasonably dry.  There's hedges about 8 metres in free heights it's casuaria, oleander underneath, this }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19901}{\*\bkmkend ldl19901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the conventional farm on\~the other side.  It's about covering, green manure to cover the soil.  Here we have buttercup oxalis, we have also wild grains and beans.  About the soil it's producing biofertiliser on the site, to improve the micro biology of\~the soil, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl19952}{\*\bkmkend ldl19952}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that itself it's not a direct nutrients but it's going to make the nutrients available from the soil.  So this is what compositing is working with 5 minutes I have to go a bit faster.  \line \tab       This is about crop biodiversity, they are trying to starting to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20001}{\*\bkmkend ldl20001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}grow wild varieties of avocado which you can see on\~the pictures, solar power is also been put on the farm.  It's about creating habitats for wild diversity it's about\~the pest control with natural methods here we have the ladybird, here we have traps. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20051}{\*\bkmkend ldl20051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}At the end of it this is what the polygon looks like.  We have some very strong density there, that's not because they are so bad at that, but because the software system didn't allow me\~to switch off seven parameters that are not relevant to that }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20101}{\*\bkmkend ldl20101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}particular farm.  \line \tab       Part of the scores were a bit lower because there wasn't the actual documentation the paperwork, that would be there.  So what I can say as\~a\~result is produce quantity and quality as well as diversity went up within the course of five years.  Soil }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20152}{\*\bkmkend ldl20152}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}quality and quantity went up as well.  The water use was reduced by about 25%, the electricity cost to the site was reduced by about 50%, and no further investment was required regarding staff.  Now that is not although probably not }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20201}{\*\bkmkend ldl20201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that exciting, but I have figures which I have not put here because I literally just got them yesterday the avocado in 2010 they harvested which I when they start with all these measures, they harvested 48,000 kg, that went up to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20251}{\*\bkmkend ldl20251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}2014, to 95,000 so nearly doubled.  Orange in 2010, 17,000 kg, in 2014, nearly 50,000 kg.  Pomegranate that started 2012 only a few years ago with it, so it\~was 12,000 kg yield in 2014, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20302}{\*\bkmkend ldl20302}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}65,000 kg went up partly because the trees were still young growing themselves.  Kumquat in 2014, so doubled as well.  Which I think is pretty impressive.  As a conclusion I would say the SAFA tool shows }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20351}{\*\bkmkend ldl20351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}an important degree of sustainability on the polygon plot, in this particular case study it's an accessible tool everyone can use it, it's open source and it covers the main sustainability to picks that are relevant to permaculture as well.  \line \tab       It's fairly easy to use, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20401}{\*\bkmkend ldl20401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the drawback probably is still that it's mainly qualitative, so it doesn't evaluate the practices per\~se in putting them into figures which means doing experiments probably over a long period of time, but I think the thing it's a nice tool to get the first impression of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20451}{\*\bkmkend ldl20451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the farm, and also to start bridging the gap towards government because you are using the tool that's internationally accepted.

We were also looking at a number of different frameworks with Coventry University and the Permaculture Association.  SAFA, the SAFA framework was one of 15 to 20 that we did a literature review on.  It was really interesting to hear you talk about it being a self-assessment tool, we assessed it was far from being a self-assessment tool and perhaps it wasn't appropriate for Smallholders, because it's extremely lengthy and complex, as you actually used the tool, I was fascinated to hear you say those things about it.  Can you talk a little bit about why you think it's a could assessment tool, from our point of view we would send an expert to use, you are an academic and used it on a farm, do you think not just the farm you worked on, but a smaller scale farm would be able to use the framework in the same way?  . }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

I think that the questions are easy to understand, to the farmer.  He can work with that framework.  Now, having somebody external doing the assessment has the advantage that it's probably not as biased and there is somebody to discuss with, actually I found it very useful to discuss things with Monolo face to face, because some things we had to discuss.  How is\~it really.  So, in theory, yes I think a farmer could work with that.  Umm... because the questions are, understandable, they are written in English, it's not, not really much jargon, I find to be honest I haven't, I haven't tested that part of it.  I mean, maybe there are some amongst you who would say, "Ok, I'll take up that challenge and please send me the questionnaire, I'll see what I can do with it, if I can work with it and then we can discuss."  That person can discuss things with me and if I can't solve the problem I can hand it over to Nadia who developed the system and to FAO. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  There is a follow-on to that actually, because at 116 questions,, it's a simple and easy to understand, I don't want to fill in 116 questions and I'm really nerdy and into this stuff, so... }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:18002"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}umm... is there a SAFA lite!

That's why FAO developed a small app, or a small SAFA tool, which I've also tried, it's only 100 questions - \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}.  It's more like ticking boxes, so it's, it's probably easier.  Again, my feeling was, that was also Monolo's that the large tool is more for really big companies and the small tool is for probably more umm... how... family-owned farms, probably more in the global south where you would have a question like, "Have all the members of the farm been able to have three meals a day during the past..."  However months or so.  So some of the topics are not really relevant to Spain, where people usually still have plenty of food, thank God. \line \tab       So, I think what one can say, it's a good starting point and the tool needs to be develop and adapted to permaculture and that, surely, is something I would love to do and I would also invite others amongst you to co-develop that. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Just\~one quick question, did the - Monolo may be able to answer this as well as you.  Did it make the farm far more profitable, in terms of rolling it out to other commercial-sized farms, that's going to be the key driver?  . }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

Well, I think there is a lot of experiments going on, on the farm and some experiments don't go the way you expected and some investments may have gone the wrong - you know, it may not lead to what you hoped for.  So it really umm... it's really thanks to, probably the to the way the company is set up that they have enough financial means to buffer things when they don't go the way really they wanted.  So, this, like space for being able to experiment and not go bankrupt because one experiment didn't work out, that is important, but I think this can also be done on a smaller scale, because your experiments can be on a small scale, you can still experiment and if it doesn't go well it's not going to be dramatic. \line KEVIN MOREL:  Thank you. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

So in the last presentation, Federico Filippi will discuss the idea of arable permaculture, because theoretically most arable systems rely on the cultivation of arable crops with soil tillage, on the first side it can seem paradoxical with the idea of permaculture, so Federico Filippi will go beyond this apparent paradox and tell us about the way you can rethink agriculture in the light of permaculture. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sb100\sa100\s31\sl360\slmult1\itap0{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch FEDRICO FILIPPI:  Ok, hello, good afternoon, I'm delighted to be here.  A little bit about me, like many in the Permaculture Movement I've a very unconventional background, started of studying religion and philosophy, specialising in the Indian traditions and started off as a gardener, that's how I got into permaculture, and eventually the food transition and I'm now at the centre for ago ecology, water and resistance at Coventry. \line \tab       You will hopefully have come across our stand here at the conference, the centre for agroecology at Coventry is probably the best place to do permaculture in the UK. \line \tab       Ok, I thought I would start by going through some basic definitions.  It actually took me many years to come across this, very often }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:19001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we use a words without knowing their, without knowing their origin.  If you look at two key words, agriculture and arable, their Latin meaning is very revealing about what they are about, agriculture comes from the Latin 'Ager' that comes from field and therefore comes from the management of fields, not forest.  Arable, even more interesting, comes from 'Arare' being Italian means to plough, \uc1\u8216\'91aratro\uc1\u8217\'92 is plough.  It tells us what arable farming is about, what its basic characteristics are, tillage, some kind of farm tools, it involves fields as opposed to forests or different types of vegetation, dominated by grasses, annual plants. \line \tab       Given that we have been here for two days, I'm not going to teach you or tell you about definitions of permaculture, but I just thought I would provide a couple of basic definitions which I'm sure many of you have come across.  These are the basic definitions I'm working with as a basis when I'm talking about arable permaculture particularly the second one, the conscious design and maintenance of agriculturally productive ecosystems. \line \tab       So one of the things I noticed when I got into this field was that there was an internal debate in permaculture, but also in the other alternative agricultural disciplines, a debate about agriculture itself.   I put a few quotes which I found particularly interesting, also quite amusing.  For\~example \uc1\u8220\'93gambolling about }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20701}{\*\bkmkend ldl20701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the plain and forest, hunting living off\~the land is fun.  Farming is not."  Now of\~course I would suggested they have not been to the right farm or perhaps they found hunting really easy.  Similarly, sustainable agriculture is of\~an oxymoron.  Agroculture is }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20751}{\*\bkmkend ldl20751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}intrinsically unnatural, there's something not natural about it 10,000 years of conflict between agriculture and nature.  I could have gone on with other example, but there's a current of thought a trend in the permaculture movement which sees something intrinsically problematic with agriculture itself.  \line \tab  }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20801}{\*\bkmkend ldl20801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}    There\~are certainly some arguments in favour of this, I have offered a few which a synopsis of some of them.  The first goes back to the whole issue of }{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}aratro}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, the plough, that continues soil disturbance the turning of the soil, is not something that }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20851}{\*\bkmkend ldl20851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}happens very often in nature.  Of\~course we can talk about the hooves of animals disturbing soil allowing seeds to germinate, but general speaking it's not something that happens common in nature.  \line \tab       Also perennial plants toned dominate mature ecosystems, whether in temperate or tropical or arctic }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20901}{\*\bkmkend ldl20901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}climates, perennials tend to dominate.  Monoculture is also very common in nature, as we saw in other talks, polyculture is based on\~the premise that it doesn't work in there\~are also been historical arguments again agriculture, anthropologist historians have argued that the adoption }{\*\bkmkstart ldl20951}{\*\bkmkend ldl20951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of agriculture has led\~to increased malnutrition, poverty disease }{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}et cetera}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}.  Similarly, it's led to greater inequalities, society with great hierarchies, more conflicts, war, some have node that very often agriculture societies run out of land to grow enough food to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21001}{\*\bkmkend ldl21001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}feed themselves it's led\~to expansion and imperial cultures.  \line \tab       I will point some counter arguments.  The first one is yes, soil disturbance is not that common in nature, but of\~course there's a big difference we can different methods of cultivating the extent to which it's cultivated, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21052}{\*\bkmkend ldl21052}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the method used and the consequences vary enormously.  \line \tab       I think the annual and perennial divide is sometimes unhelpful, there\~are of\~course many annual plants in nature, seems\~to me there\~is nothing intrinsically less natural about an annual flower, whether it's cultivated by human or\~not.  Nothing }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21102}{\*\bkmkend ldl21102}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}less natural about it than a perennial.  \line \tab       Third point of\~course going back to the issue of polyculture, agrofarming system does not necessarily involve monoculture.  Of\~course you wouldn't know this if you went around the British countryside, you went to East Anglia all you }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21151}{\*\bkmkend ldl21151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}saw was miles and miles of barley and wheat, but arable farming has not always been about monoculture.  \line \tab       There\~are some examples of sustainable farming systems historically.  One of\~the points I missed on the earlier slide I just realised was there have been failures, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21201}{\*\bkmkend ldl21201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}for\~example the fertile crest is often mentioned as an example of a place where agriculture started very early, effectively failed, now not so fertile.  The same pattern is true in north Africa, but there\~are also many examples of\~the opposite parts of\~the would where agriculture }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21251}{\*\bkmkend ldl21251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}seems to have worked and not destroyed the fundamentals of stability, soil }{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}et cetera}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}. I am not going to get too much into the latter points the socio political issues, but it seems to me famine, malnutrition and poverty are not the sole results }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21301}{\*\bkmkend ldl21301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of agriculture, there\~are many societies both now in the past with same problems.  Similarly for conflicts, scale and complexity of conflicts differs between hunter gatherer societies, and agriculture civilisation.  It seems to me that human nature is more of\~an issue more }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21351}{\*\bkmkend ldl21351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}tan which way humans get food.  \line \tab       The same is for the latter point, it's true that all empires, all imperial culture, all participatory culture it doesn't mean it's the course, could be the condition but not the cause.  Arable permaculture, still a question }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21401}{\*\bkmkend ldl21401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}mark because I am still trying to define I go pack to definition of permaculture I used at the beginning by definition it must be a system which has the same resilience and characteristics of a natural system.  It needs to fit into that fundamental definition.  \line \tab       In terms of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21451}{\*\bkmkend ldl21451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}an arable system, given it's based on as we saw earlier fields and grass, it should be basically modelled on natural ecosystems which are dominated pike herbivores.  Of\~course round the world me have many examples from the grass plains of North\~America to Central Asia, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21501}{\*\bkmkend ldl21501}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}et cetera}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}.  Of\~course even in this country, many examples of ecosystems where grass ants herbivores coexist in symbiosis.  It has to be a mixed farming system, again our conventional arable farming we have in the UK will not fit that criteria, it's not a }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21551}{\*\bkmkend ldl21551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}mixed farming system it's not integrated, the crop are not grown with animals side by side.  I think it should include an important perennial element, so once annual crops maybe the main at put or main sources of nourishment for society, it should include perennial elements. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21601}{\*\bkmkend ldl21601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}I mentioned agroforestry, hedgerows, }{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}et cetera}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, an integration of perennial and annual very\~important.  \line \tab       Also I think you should remain connected with the other activities.  It's not as if when humans took up agriculture they suddenly forgot how to fish, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21652}{\*\bkmkend ldl21652}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}hunt and gather.  In fact in most cultures it's like this traditionally at least for industrial age, good farmer was also a good gatherer.  Will have seasonal hunting, fishing }{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}et cetera}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, and of\~course horticulture, most farm houses will still have a garden.  The }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21702}{\*\bkmkend ldl21702}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}farmer did not abandon those activities, just no longer relies on them for his main livelihood.  \line \tab       Basic model I am thinking of England mostly, but of\~course this could apply to other temperate climates or other parts of Northern Europe, would have to be centred }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21751}{\*\bkmkend ldl21751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}round this idea of herbivores and grass, and arable fields.  These 3 elements all combined.  Cultivated grasses, legumes, many other annual crops and many other which could be introduced.  In England we have a few precedents there\~are a few }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21801}{\*\bkmkend ldl21801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}examples in England which could be a guidance for now in the future.  During the agriculture revolution some interesting crop rotation systems were introduced such are the Norfolk focus rotation.  It\~was very common to fold animals on arable land a great connection between crops and bee}{\*\bkmkstart ldl21851}{\*\bkmkend ldl21851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}keeping, livestock, a\~lot of\~the elements of sustainable agriculture were there, so we wouldn't be starting from scratch.  \line \tab       A little bit about my own project I have gone on a bit too long, I work at the manner the headquarters of\~the Hare Krishna movement, there's a farm with }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21901}{\*\bkmkend ldl21901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}over a hundred acres of land, nine acres of arable land am in charge of four of those, this is a conventional farm to a certain extent it's part of the movement, so it's main goal is\~to provide food for the farm kitchen, for the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl21951}{\*\bkmkend ldl21951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}community we have a farm shop }{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}et cetera}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}.  I have been there for over three years now I have introduced a number of crops I am proud to say, this year I introduced grains for the first time.  \line \tab       Broadly speaking, I like to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22001}{\*\bkmkend ldl22001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}think that my arable system I modelled on some good permaculture principles.  Briefly, apart from some more traditional methods in arable farming such as crop rotation I have also been trying to experiment with polycultures on a field scale in the early talk there was a discussion }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22051}{\*\bkmkend ldl22051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}about polyculture and scale I am trying to do it on a\~very big field scale.  \line \tab       A complete dependence on livestock it's not just infertility maintenance and manure, but also the using of animals it's one of the few farms in England where we uses animals }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22102}{\*\bkmkend ldl22102}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to cultivate land.  The complete exclusion of any industrial methods, we gone way beyond the organic as well, the soil association.  The inclusion of perennials which we talked about earlier, my field is generally a sloping field a four acre field up on a small hill. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22151}{\*\bkmkend ldl22151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}In the lower part of the field I have got this little perennial strip which act like a sponge, so we get lots of water run off during the winter, so I have got this perennial zone with things like chicory, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22202}{\*\bkmkend ldl22202}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}which has roots, acts like a sponge.  Again observing the local environment, the characteristics, hydrology and so on and acting accordingly.  Excuse me.  \line \tab       Ok, a few examples, I mention grains, I have introduced this year I guess one }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22251}{\*\bkmkend ldl22251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of\~the distinctive features between the way I am trying to do grains and most organic farmers I am using ancient varieties which are really tall, man height I am not very tall I know, but possibly talking than we, really, really tall varieties, very hardy they have }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22301}{\*\bkmkend ldl22301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}no competition with wheat, grow extremely fast and tall, ideal for a system where you are happy to produce wheat.  They produce a\~lot of less grain, good quality, lots of biomass, lots of straw which is both food and fertility.  Also experimented with }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22351}{\*\bkmkend ldl22351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}other what you call pseudo grains such as buck wheat there in the middle.  Legumes, very\~important, I think one of the least grown crops in the UK, we should grow much more of them, very\~important for soil fertility, pollination and of\~course nutrition, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22401}{\*\bkmkend ldl22401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}I found that winter legume seems to be the best for the soil conditions, also trial and error, also lots of fodder crops, sown just about now and harvested in the spring.  I was really keen\~to show you this.  When I first got }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22451}{\*\bkmkend ldl22451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}into permaculture I got really upset with the 3 sisters method, I fanned it a neat form of permaculture, who has come across the Three Sisters method?  I thought so.  So there's a few variations, there\~is also a fourth sister snuck in sometimes, she }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22501}{\*\bkmkend ldl22501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}could be tobacco or sunflowers.  My goal was to say could we do this on a field scale from seed, seems to me lack the out puts would be phenomenal, you could have grain crop, i.e the corn, you could have a legume if you choose }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22551}{\*\bkmkend ldl22551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to use one, a sunflower, seed crop and squash on the ground it could be a fresh vegetable crop, also a fodder crop has got phenomenal potential as a fodder crop both the seeds and the actual fruit.   \line \tab       .   Fixed results, every year it's improving, this year I think I found the best combination, beans had to go, squash, sweet corn and sunflower, I hope that next year or maybe the year after I will come back with some interesting yield figures, it could be a really good example of a polyculture, very high yielding on a field scale. \line \tab       Fodder crops, not going to go too much into this, but suffice to say in this system it's not to use crops which are really for human consumption, i.e. grains to feed cattle, which are herbivores.  There are some dedicated crops for, for the livestock, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:19501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}but also livestock are really fed on all kinds of agriculture waste, biomass that we cannot eat.  So the arable fields provide a lot of the food for the animals but in a way in which we're not taking anything away from the permanent role of the arable farming which is to provide food for people. \line \tab       Just a few pictures.  I felt I did not put quite enough pictures in the early part of the presentation.  Here are animals eating the real mixed fodder, lot of different plants in that fodder.  Brassica, father and son actually, holding turnips and radishes, this is a actual purpose crop, we eat but also feed to animals, very important to eat. \line \tab       Animal }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}draught}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, this is very important, it's probably the only conference where this would not be seen as really, really out of touch, I hope some of your colleagues ask about this.  So yes, we use animals cultivate the land, it does many things for me, apart from integrating on a very real, practical level the cultivation of crops with herbivores, it's also, it really does reflect the idea that I'm trying to recreate an ecosystem dominated by domesticated plants and animals, their manure goes on the field as well as the labour.  There are of course common exceptions to this which have to be taken seriously, it would take a huge societal change to convert to the use of just animals and not machinery, some of the draught animals have to be fed purposefully, of course they have to be fed but like other farm animals they can be eaten, this will not happen at the Hare Krishna farm!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  I\~have to make this clear, in case my colleagues get hold of this presentation and think I'm promoting the consumption of animals.  We do retire them, but they should not be retired to farms where they might end up in the Sunday roasts. \line \tab       A valid option, for people in permaculture, would be to use on the farm biofuel or alcohol that could be another option for the arable farmer.  Arable farming will require energy to till the soil, if you have an arable permaculture system, apart from animal draught that would be ideal, the only other option is to have energy produced on the farm. \line \tab       Again a few pictures, your humble servant is there with the hat.  We also use them for festivals and general transportation, in that people picture we are harrowing the field, there is a yoke which we make ourselves.  I know I've only got one minute left, I wanted to finish on weeds, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:20004"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}they are inevitable, in any arable system they literally follow the plough.  In my system, yes, they are a management issue, something which is, which I have to keep in mind all the time, but it should\~not be seen as a problem of course, both from, shall I say a philosophical point of view and a practical point of view.  How do we manage them, or how do I manage them.  Apart from, of course, in some cases cultivation one of the purposes of ploughing is to bury weeds so I can put seeds in, apart from two weed varieties are edible.  We also use them as food.  There are two weeds, Fat then, or pig weed, that believe it or not we harvested throughout all the growing season and sell.  Very popular in the Indian community, they are very delicious, they are as nice if not better than spinach and chard.  They show by themselves. \line \tab       The last point, it kind of encapsulates a lot of my ideas.  These two weeds, Amarantha and fat hen, they grow by themselves in his field, that tells me that the cultivated varieties which are Quinoa, Fat Hen is wild Quinoa and Amaranth should grow really, really well on our field.  This year we tried, last two seasons we tried with Amaranth, it grows really, really well, we have looked at which plants thrive in that environment and we say ok, we are growing domesticated animals, we can take some guidance of what grows without our assistance and use that guidance to grow our crops.  What is trying the Amaranth is already cross breeding with the wild variety, that's really exciting. \line \tab       Conclusions, I too believe, I'm a big defender of agriculture, I do not see a clash with permaculture necessarily, it depends on what agriculture we are talking about, it can provide a critique to provide a way forward rather than eliminate agriculture.  As we saw in other presentations over the last two days, a lot of traditional farming systems do practice permaculture, they just don't do it consciously, there are permaculture practices in traditional agriculture, that are done without the awareness that they are permaculture.  What permaculture can do is provide a way to really, to really both innovate but }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:20501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}also keep what is best and what is, what has worked and what is sustainable. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

Just before the coffee break. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Hello, I was discussing with somebody over lunch, how would we replace industrial field-scale grain growing, I think you touched on some aspects of that, how to make a grain growing work on a mixed farm.  I wonder if we need to sort of also consider how we tackle very large-scale industrial grain farming you see in, for instance, Russia, America or Australia. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sb100\sa100\s31\sl360\slmult1\itap0{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch FEDRICO FILIPPI:  So your question is, how do we address the large-scale industrial growth of grains in other regions. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  If we suppose the supply of fossil fuels will contract and they aren't possible where do we go in terms of replacements. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sb100\sa100\s31\sl360\slmult1\itap0{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch FEDRICO FILIPPI:  Ok, right.  There is a few approaches, one of course is I think we should grow less grains, whether we are in England or North America or other traditional regions which, where there is lots of grains growing, I think we should grow less grains.  So there is scope, for example, for converting a lot of arable land, in places like the ones you have mentioned say in North America, converting them back to grassland and then keeping some of the best land for arable to grow grains but also other crops.  I do, I really do believe, potentially, the use of animal draught could be a solution for many parts of the world.  As I said biofuels as well, provided they're not from crops grown just for that purpose.  My understanding is that the United States, until about a century ago, many farmers did produce their own alcohol on farm, often from cross waste.  So, they would, of course those days farmers had lots of orchards and apples and other things, so very often with the surplus or waste they would make their own alcohol and put it in the tractor and use that.  Yes, it's a huge challenge if oil and gas are no longer available or diminishing or we just choose not to use them, there is a huge challenge because we need energy.  As I said, the way I would tackle it is, less cultivation, less grains and then the two alternatives which are animals and on farm energy, but there are no easy solutions. \line KEVIN MOREL:  Maybe just\~one }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:21001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}last, short question and short answer because we---. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  You haven't touched on the delicate subject of eating meat or eating less meat.  Obviously you don't eat meet. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sb100\sa100\s31\sl360\slmult1\itap0{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch FEDRICO FILIPPI:  In my scheme of things I think it's - eating meat is perfectly compatible with an arable permaculture system, in fact because, to my mind the integration between livestock and arable is so important, you know, by default meat would be one of the outputs of the farm, unless you have moral or religious reasons like the Hare Krishnas not to slaughter animals, inevitably you will have the possibility of eating meat as well as diary and other products. \line \tab       Of course I think say in the UK we have the cultural adoption of these sort of methods, we probably would end up producing less of certain types of meet, less poultry and less pork, perhaps not pork, but poultry there wouldn't be very right feeding for animals, there would be huge scope for eating herbivores, so beef }{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}et cetera}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} will still be major parts of the diet.  So my view is, if animals are fed sustainably on crop waste, all the things that we cannot eat and of course grass, herbivores are meant eat grass, of course it has to be nose to tail eating, not in the way we are eating now.  For me it's not - to me vegan farming or agriculture is not compatible with this view or even with permaculture. \line KEVIN MOREL:  Thank you.

Indeed, Kenneth Balding stated }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22652}{\*\bkmkend ldl22652}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in the 1950s, anyone who believes that unlimited growth is possible in\~a limited world is either a mad man or an economist.  \line \tab       I have not insulted a few economists at that time where\~I repeat this but he could say it because he\~was an economist, and }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22701}{\*\bkmkend ldl22701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}his colleague in the next building also at the University of Boulder he stated many times, the greatest imperfection of mankind is that it does not understand the consequences of expansion growth.  \line \tab       This something we need\~to address in the education system.  We need\~to\~a }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22752}{\*\bkmkend ldl22752}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}new framework, when\~I started looking into what is sustainability all about, I was very happy to find this framework, or a compass from my friend Alan Atkinson who's a sustainability change leader.  So north is for nature, east is for the economy, south }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22801}{\*\bkmkend ldl22801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is for society, and west is for the well being of people.

Let me plot the ethics of\~the permaculture movement, on to this, so you see there the earth care, the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22851}{\*\bkmkend ldl22851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}fair share and the people care are fit into the compass.  \line \tab       What I am going to talk about I also fitted that into a compass to avoid bullet points.  Where I have been working in the last 15 years, what I will talk }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22901}{\*\bkmkend ldl22901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}about today is\~the availability of natural resources and how long they will last and how they are linked to\~the economy, and what sort of new economic systems we need.  I will also talk about the sustainable development goals and how you society might look like that achieves these }{\*\bkmkstart ldl22951}{\*\bkmkend ldl22951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}goals.  \line \tab       At the basis of our economy are our natural resources you could say that energy plus phosphorus, or oil plus phosphorus, creates food and people.  This is then through work we can turn this into wealth, and on top of this wealth }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23001}{\*\bkmkend ldl23001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we can have a creative bubble of arts, but without these resources we could\~not have an economy.  We could look at this as an ecosystem so the first level the prime production then is\~the energy food that creates the people, and then the secondary production is\~the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23051}{\*\bkmkend ldl23051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}work, and the third tier is civilisation.  \line \tab       So how can we then look into how long we can continue to have the economic system that we\~have today, into the future because until now we have had plenty of resources.  \line \tab       I am having }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23101}{\*\bkmkend ldl23101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}trouble with the stuff here... \line \tab       So over the past few years I have been working with Harald, a Norwegian engineer who is also interested in sustainability issues. We have been analysing over 40 different natural resources how long they will last.  It's very similar to\~the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23151}{\*\bkmkend ldl23151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}work of Dennis Meadows and his colleagues in limits to growth which was published in 1972, and if we analyse where we are now we have followed the standard run, which was one of\~the scenarios they looked into which was business as usual. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23201}{\*\bkmkend ldl23201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}We have, we are right on track which is not good as you will say, but in their analysis they run energy and all the resources together, and looked into the consequences of population growth and the use of these resources.  In our }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23251}{\*\bkmkend ldl23251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}analysis all\~the resources are separated because the computer capacity is now much bigger.  They ran their model, it took three weeks at the biggest computer in the US at MIT, but we can run it on a laptop, this is what computer }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23301}{\*\bkmkend ldl23301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}technology has done for us in over 40 years.  \line \tab       This issue just came out it's over 200 pages on geochemical perspectives, it's available online for those who are interested.  \line \tab       Can we have unlimited growth, this is a }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23351}{\*\bkmkend ldl23351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}logarithmic plot so those of you who remind maths, if you take the logarithm of an exponentional curve you get a straight line.  Annual production from 1900 to 2010, you can see that these curves continue\~to rise and rise and rise, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23401}{\*\bkmkend ldl23401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and what you do is remember for each doubling time, if it's 7%, then the doubling time is 10 years.  Then that production is more than all the other doubling times before.  If you can think that this can continue forever, then we will start }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23451}{\*\bkmkend ldl23451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}mining into the large part of the mass of\~the earth and of\~course that's not possible.  \line \tab       Indeed, all of you know about peak oil, we have passed peak oil, we're about to pass peak coal, which means we can pass peak energy because we can }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23501}{\*\bkmkend ldl23501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}never has as much renewable energy as the cheap oil we have had.  So the reason why the curves come to a maximum is because we have a think about this as a Coke bottle you start sucking and all of\~a sudden you\~have consumed of it, then }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23551}{\*\bkmkend ldl23551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}you will empty it.  That is exactly what is happening here.  So it will, we will reach a maximum then we go down on the other end, these are the resources which are much more difficult to get and more expensive.  \line \tab       This is Colin }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23601}{\*\bkmkend ldl23601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Campbell, an oil geologist demonstrating it in Ireland.  He invited me to a conference in Ireland saying here I am, I want\~to make all my data about oil public, please come and see whether we can't do this together with all\~the other resources.  \line \tab       So }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23652}{\*\bkmkend ldl23652}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}doesn't matter how we complain, this is where we are.  We have consumed half of\~the oil.  This is\~the same for all the other resources that we have looked at, we have either reached peak production or we will reach it very soon.  Most }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23702}{\*\bkmkend ldl23702}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of them before 2030.  We know pretty much how\~much is available of these resources.  This is very well collated, both by mining companies and various geological surveys including the us geological survey.  Among these is peak phosphate }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23751}{\*\bkmkend ldl23751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and what is what we use for fertiliser and peak soil, this is why permaculture is so important because we have used \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  and destroyed, we have destroyed half of our soils, and we will not have industrial fertilisers much into the future because it }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23801}{\*\bkmkend ldl23801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}will be too expensive for most people to use.  \line \tab       If we have business as usual how long will this resources last, these are over 40 resources, everything is red will be consumed up within the next hundred years.  If it's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23851}{\*\bkmkend ldl23851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}orange it's between 100 and 200, if it light orange it\uc1\u8217\'92s up\~to 1000. As you can see it's only over 10,000 years when it gets dark green.  So the only way to do this is by recycling, we're not very good at that. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23901}{\*\bkmkend ldl23901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}If we recycle 50% you can see they last a bit longer, 90%, even more longer.  95 now we get into thousands of years for most.  Then if we decrease the population by half, \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} even longer, this is just a scenario }{\*\bkmkstart ldl23951}{\*\bkmkend ldl23951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} to show the population is important, like Jonathan Porritt said today it's always the elephant in the room, no-one wants to talk about population but it's important.  Here we have half the population and half the consumption we have, so the consumption level\~and population }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24001}{\*\bkmkend ldl24001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}level and recycling will, can tell us how long these resources can last.  \line \tab       Now, it would be nice if we thought that my consuming all these resources we have generated good societies, but what do we find?  Well we have had }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24051}{\*\bkmkend ldl24051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}GDP rising, but the general progress indicator which takes away all\~the bad, the environmental destructions and adds on voluntary work has levelled if not gone down since the 1970s.  So GDP is not a\~very good indicator for the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24101}{\*\bkmkend ldl24101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}success of nations.  \line \tab       If we look at this, most of the GDP since the early 70s, oil peaked in the United\~States has been built on debt.  So we have been raising debt so we can be sure we're having GDP }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24151}{\*\bkmkend ldl24151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}growth.  We have created societies with incredible inequalities between countries but also within countries.  We have a financial system on steroids where the GDP globally is \'a363 trillion, but \'a3600 trillion are traded as futures and derivatives the future resources which }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24201}{\*\bkmkend ldl24201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}probably don't exist and in currency trading.  This whole system is operating legally, and gambling with our money.  I looked at this financial paper this morning that I picked up at the train station, there\~are shaky markets all over the place.  So when we will }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24251}{\*\bkmkend ldl24251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}have the next collapse I don't\~know, but it might be soon.  \line \tab       Now in unequal societies we also have many more societal problems, so here we have the USA, Portugal and UK which are very unequal, then we\~have very high health and societal problems. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24301}{\*\bkmkend ldl24301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Whereas countries with low inequality like Japan and Scandinavian countries have lower societal problems.  Also if you look at the happiness of peoples since the 50s, it has not really changed, maybe gone down, but the income level has gone up so }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24351}{\*\bkmkend ldl24351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}money does not make us happy.  You already knew that.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} \line \tab       so how do did we\~get here?  We had this very linear way of thinking, we dig up a resource like phosphorus, we make fertiliser, we dump it on\~the farm it goes into }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24401}{\*\bkmkend ldl24401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a river and causes algae blooms, and death zones in rivers and oceans.  We have this coming from a man going to society and then to dump 100% and 100% is lost.  What we need to do is recycle.  If we recycle, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24451}{\*\bkmkend ldl24451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}then this is\~the basis of the circular economy that the EU is now working towards.  In industry we need\~to\~learn from nature and create industries that use the waste of another industry for their production.  \line \tab       This is all possible we just have to put our mind }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24501}{\*\bkmkend ldl24501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to\~it.  \line \tab       So what we're doing building a world model, like I said before, similar limits to growth but much more detail we have population, economy, and resources, and food module and ecological module, and this is all the results so\~far can }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24551}{\*\bkmkend ldl24551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}be found in this issue I talked about before.  \line \tab       So resources are very\~much at the base of the economy.  We need to remember that.  \line \tab       We have tested our model back to roman times just\~to see there\~is some academic rigour behind this.  Here }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24601}{\*\bkmkend ldl24601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}you can see we have the amount of silver and coins in Rome, these are the actual numbers this is our model, modelling the relative roman army size and cash flow, and coins and so on.  We can actually predict these crashes, we have }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24651}{\*\bkmkend ldl24651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}been able to predict the fall of the Russian Empire, and the British Empire was almost dismantled just before they collapsed, maybe they knew what they were doing I don't\~know.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} \line \tab \tab So in 2012 I got this incredible email from\~the prime\~minister of Bhutan signed by the King I }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24701}{\*\bkmkend ldl24701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}almost hit delete but decided maybe I should open it, I was invited to the united\~nations to discuss with many hundreds sustainability experts how we could put the gross national happiness measure of Bhutan which is an indicator that they use, instead of GDP, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24751}{\*\bkmkend ldl24751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}into the sustainability development goals.  We didn't quite achieve that, although we did send a report to\~the United\~Nations because government in Bhutan changed and the new Prime\~Minister didn't think that gross national happiness was so important, maybe GDP was important after all, this is }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24801}{\*\bkmkend ldl24801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}how politics can change things \line \tab       A group of us formulated the alliance for sustainability and prosperity, we have been writing papers together, this one came out in nature last year and geoscientist, looking at how society could look at that is committed to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24851}{\*\bkmkend ldl24851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}sustainable development goals.  \line \tab       Basically of\~course, we need\~to\~live within the earth's support system, within that we need\~to\~have society and economy within these boundaries.  Not the other way round as it is today.  \line \tab       So the ultimate goal would then be a }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24901}{\*\bkmkend ldl24901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}sustainable prosperous and equitable well being for humans and the rest of nature.  We could do that by including all\~the capital aspects of nature, the built human and social, this is ecological economics principles, we would have a new development paradigm that aims }{\*\bkmkstart ldl24951}{\*\bkmkend ldl24951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}for ecological sustainable and fair distribution, regenerative economy and living democracy, we would meet all human needs, we would make sure that if necessary we would teach happiness skills and then this goal could be reached.  \line \tab       Some of the writing has been in }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25001}{\*\bkmkend ldl25001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the journal solutions if you don't know about that it's a hybrid academic journal magazine which has solutions for sustainable societies.  In\~the latest issue there\~was something about permaculture.  So that might be an issue you might want to look at.  We have classified the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25051}{\*\bkmkend ldl25051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}different targets that are 17 targets in the sustainable development goals, and I am sorry there\~are 17 goals, over hundred targets and how they are linked with the natural social and economic capitals.  We have come up with something that we call the 'Republic of Well-being', or the 'Gelato Society', that was in the Guardian last week.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  .  I think it was on the 2nd September.  So why the Gelato Society, we have two Italians }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:22501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}amongst us, everybody likes ice cream!  Then we would make sure that the echo logical life support system is the cone and the society and economy would be in balance.  Who wouldn't want to live in the '}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Gelato}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} Society'.  So how does that look, I put that also into the compost.  We would work on nature regeneration, regenerative economy.  Business would have environmental responsibility, nature would take human rights as already in Bolivia, Ecuador and New Zealand we will map up the environmental and economic effects of electoral programmes, sustainability in The Constitution, a living democracy and be committed to the SDGs and an ecosystem and human well-being.  I welcome all of you to this new society.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line \tab       However, we come to see that it's complicated to get there, because some of the goals may interfere with the others, so we are now doing, I have a student working with me, Harold, doing spectrum analysis on the goals and all the targets, so this is basically how the world works, we have the resources and the methods and materials, here we have the society and the goals.  What strikes, what struck us straight away is that natural resources aren't really within these goals and neither is equality or corruption and social trust, so there is something missing there that we need to point out to those who want to achieve these goals.  The ideal ethical principals for the Republic of Well-being are of course the permaculture ones - \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} - earth care, fair share and people care.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line \tab       There are many hopeful signs, you know, there is lots going on and so I'm the opt mist, the EU is aiming for the circular economy, there is a huge degrowth movement going on in the French and Spanish speaking world of Europe, China has a new constitution, in that they have an ecological society they want to build up, parallel currency coming up, different economies sharing solidarity, service economies of course we have the Transition Towns, eco-villages and permaculture, hopefully you are all going in the right direction.  People are claiming the rights of the commons through, for example, the initiative of claiming the sky, we should claim the atmosphere as ours and sue companies.  There are 90 companies only that put out 70% of the C02 and the greenhouse gases so that's fairly easy to do.  Join us please, sign it!  We have young people suing the governments in the Netherlands in the US and winning and the courts are telling governments that they have to look, think about young people and their future and kerb emissions.  We have the eradicating ecosite in Britain.  Finally, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:23001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}I'm a geologist, I }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}have}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} been thinking about the link between resources and the economics for the last five years since I came back to Iceland in 2008, I thought I have to understand what's going on.  Here we have a whole economy crashing, what's going on. \line \tab       Now just my latest fun thing is to train 12 PhD students in new economic thinking, so if any of you have a Masters degree or know anybody with a Masters degree who wants to train and assist with analysis and new economic thinking, please apply, deadline is next week!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  Ok.  So for the Republic of Well-being, permaculture ethics are absolutely at the core.  Resources from the basis of our economy, we need to close the in equality gap and focus on corruption and the economic system is under going changes, is going from complex and often corrupt to global and global to simpler and ethical and local.  So, thank you very much.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line ANDY GOLDRING:  Wow!  Thank you as\~much for that Vala.

Rosemary grew up in Perth Western Australia, her play-ground was the Australian bush behind her home garden and the Swan River.  Rose studied agriculture science at Sydney university, a stint at the department of primary industry in Queensland and undertook scholarship at the Sorbonne studying rural sociology and development.  Rose was invited by Michael Young of the own university to work in Africa.  When she went to Lesotho, who inability to use her agriculture training from Sydney university was a huge shock, she'd never grown seedlings or vegetables or had answers for erosion and hunger, instead she worked in non-formal education. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

The really, really hard stuff to do.  So, just to do a bit of\~a look at who we are, and what we have done, we have been active for nearly 40 years.  Very, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25203}{\*\bkmkend ldl25203}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}very short time in life.  We have had some considerable achievements and we have heard about a\~lot of those haven't we, we have heard from Jonathan, about scaling up, we have heard about waves of permaculture from David, it's really been a rich smorgasbord}{\*\bkmkstart ldl25251}{\*\bkmkend ldl25251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} in this conference.  Even the Paris talks don't have, that we\~have on our side, is that major fact we are on\~the side of life.  \line \tab       Now that sounds simple, over so many of\~the things that we started with, people are not }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25301}{\*\bkmkend ldl25301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}on\~the side of life.  I think because we're on\~the side of life we're actually garnish.  A much greater force.  I was looking at some of the elements and patterns in permaculture that have helped us achieve so much in such a short time, 1}{\*\bkmkstart ldl25351}{\*\bkmkend ldl25351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}70 countries perhaps a million graduates, I don't\~know but it's a\~lot of people.  \line \tab       So what I want to talk about is that everyone is part of the solution.  No-one is part of the problem.  So let's look at some of the elements and processes that }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25401}{\*\bkmkend ldl25401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}got us here today, that helped us achieve, let us see if they are going to last us into the future and if not, what do we need.  So let's build on also our earlier speakers from yesterday and today.  \line \tab       Now what have we got in }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25451}{\*\bkmkend ldl25451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}permaculture?  What can you see up there?  There's a need, there's a wanting.  In some cases there's a great grief but most people maybe it would be interesting to see if human happiness goes down with increased income and use of resources without caring }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25501}{\*\bkmkend ldl25501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}for the earth.  Be a very interesting correlation if it existed, it may not, but perhaps the more we use up the less happier we are.  Be good to look at people who live frugally and see if the happiness index goes up.  \line \tab       We're }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25551}{\*\bkmkend ldl25551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}going to look\~at - entirely relevant for this new wave of permaculture that David talked about from 2002, then we're going to look at - our processes what we do and why we're so radical.  So if everyone happy with that, or were you thinking get }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25601}{\*\bkmkend ldl25601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}something else?  I have to ask \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} is that all right?  \line \tab       So I just like\~to take you back\~to need and how far some people pick up permaculture, this was in Vietnam in about, 19, 2000, 1985, gosh I have crossed }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25651}{\*\bkmkend ldl25651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the centuries, I have grown old in permaculture.  So it's a buzz to see so many young ones it's wonderful.  Fabulous.  So in 1980s when I first went to Vietnam they had 30 years of war and 30 million bomb craters, most of the houses were }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25701}{\*\bkmkend ldl25701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}like this and most of the people were as thin as a toothpick, really, really thin.  The people were hungry but satisfied they had achieved some sort of peace in their country it\~was a matter of rebuilding, they knew they couldn't go back they had 30 years of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25751}{\*\bkmkend ldl25751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}collectivisation, they hated it don't tell anyone but they liked the whole socialist communist, but collectivisation everyone moving out of their villages where they lived for hundreds of years, they loathed.  They walked away from the brick houses, left }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25801}{\*\bkmkend ldl25801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the doors floating in the wind they went back to their villages.  \line \tab       Two million men and women had died the younger generation didn't know how to farm, they had 30 years of growing rice, 15 to 30kg\~a month was the currency.  They }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25852}{\*\bkmkend ldl25852}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}really needed to get started again.  \line \tab       So there was a great need and they embraced permaculture.  \line \tab       Next thing I want to look at is our content.  Now is that dark enough, can you read it?  Like Geoff, I love the permaculture }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25901}{\*\bkmkend ldl25901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}content.  There's something profoundly beautiful and satisfying about the way it grows in depth, and in breadth over the years as you teach it.  I am easily distractible and bored if it weren't like that I would be out.  I tried lecturing something in biology }{\*\bkmkstart ldl25951}{\*\bkmkend ldl25951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}at university, I got bored I shouldn't have, I did.  What\~I loved was the permaculture and in the 30 years I have been teaching it, I have seen it evidence come in.  You know when people first started talking about changing the climate a\~lot }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26001}{\*\bkmkend ldl26001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of people said that ridiculous, 90% nitrogen, so much oxygen you can't change the climate.  In my life I have seen it change.  I have seen the evidence come in for permaculture, first of all the global problems which were brilliantly done up-to-date I }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26051}{\*\bkmkend ldl26051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}am full of admiration Vala thank you, then see how permaculture can work it that.  I have put here some of\~the outcomes rather than the course curriculum.  I think you know\~the course curriculum, but the outcomes you know if we work well with land and care of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26101}{\*\bkmkend ldl26101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the earth, we are going, all are indices will be on accumulation of natural resources.  We will look at how\~much water we\~have put back we'll look at how\~much soil we have put back how\~many species we\~have managed to save and build up.  We will have }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26151}{\*\bkmkend ldl26151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}measurement for the indices of restoration of ecosystems that become the most important thing in our economy, because without it, no gelato society is going\~to exist.  But we owe it to the future generations we cannot go on like this.  So restore and }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26201}{\*\bkmkend ldl26201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}accumulate water, soil, forest, these must be our indices.  Don't let us buy into the economists and the GDP and they won't believe us if we don't do this.  They are going to have to believe us, and we will have a }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26251}{\*\bkmkend ldl26251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}better alternative.  Much better, and they will say tell us.  So let's stay on for life, let's be the people who love life, support it and want to see it grow.  \line \tab       In terms of commerce, economy, we have been having a look }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26301}{\*\bkmkend ldl26301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}at a whole range of\~things, workshops, exciting possibilities, fabulous thinkers, that's what permaculture has got.  Then we have got the people, resilient and engaged.  When I started permaculture the main objective was that everyone would build their own garden and }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26351}{\*\bkmkend ldl26351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the first words that David and Bill used to talk about were permanence.  Then gradually the word sustainability in, there's no sustainability unless you have\~got equal inputs and at puts, we have not got\~to equal inputs to match our outputs, the word is what would you call\~it unbalance }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26401}{\*\bkmkend ldl26401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}order something, you have got a better way of thinking about it.  Then we're now talking about resilience in case of perturbation.  We have now gone from individuals now to communities to towns to cities to bioregion, to are water }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26451}{\*\bkmkend ldl26451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}sheds as a unit of work.  In\~a way we have dropped that hyper individuality that was in permaculture in the beginning we have come to a new citizens where we see ourselves as citizens of groups and members of communities.  It feels so good just to be part }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26501}{\*\bkmkend ldl26501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of\~a group, I think we have had that here today.  \line \tab       So when we look at the permaculture curriculum or knowledge that was passed on, it's got us all here today.  It has achieved superb things.  Is\~the content going\~to serve us for a challenging future? }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26551}{\*\bkmkend ldl26551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Let's see.  \line \tab       Oh that's all right you don't want to look at that anyway.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} can you see it's basically a branching pattern?  No?  Well it's got the managing director up top, then you have got the executive, then you have got all the staff }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26601}{\*\bkmkend ldl26601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}people who sign things and do things and say you can and you cannot, and finally down the bottom you have got someone else.  Which are the people, us really.  So what we find in that model and that process, is that everything new }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26651}{\*\bkmkend ldl26651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}has to go back up to the top.  The board will consider that when it meets in\~a month, the director is not quite happy about it, we don't like that idea, where did you go\~to school.  What's your qualifications?  We have been free of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26701}{\*\bkmkend ldl26701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that because we have had a different pattern.  So let's look at this.  \line \tab       It should be three-dimensional, thank you Dana who sent me that last night, thank you very\~much.  What we did if you don't mind a bit of history we started permaculture }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26751}{\*\bkmkend ldl26751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}with Bill and David.  It started to spread because people went out and talked.  People like me, I just I did a course with robin, I thought I going to have a go at this, a year later I was teaching.  I had eight people }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26801}{\*\bkmkend ldl26801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in my first class, two were over 90, \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} and they would fall off the chair and wake up and then fall off the chair and wake up \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} one was a radical doctor, one spent a\~lot of time telling us as you grow up and give up }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26851}{\*\bkmkend ldl26851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}singlet you should also give up knickers, but they were an interesting first class.  They came to permaculture.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} \line \tab       The next classes had something like 18, 20 people, since then been teaching two PDC a year sometimes more in the blue mountains where }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26901}{\*\bkmkend ldl26901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}I live.  Now the point about the teachers is, we have a long, long history.  We teachers have gone to the market place, we have gone to\~the plazas, we have got to\~the garages and the car ports, we have gone to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl26951}{\*\bkmkend ldl26951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the villages, and we have taught the way Socrates taught in the market place.  We have taught the way Jesus taught in the market place, Confucius.  We have a way of taking our passion and conviction at to where the people are and saying hey would }{\*\bkmkstart ldl27001}{\*\bkmkend ldl27001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}you like this, we think it worthwhile.  And so who said our first curriculum and said you\~are qualified or\~not?  I am actually not qualified, I think to be here today because I have not been properly diplomaed and certified, it's a bit of an }{\*\bkmkstart ldl27051}{\*\bkmkend ldl27051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}embarrassment \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} however I also appreciate the increasing demand for quality of teachers and asking what works.  We must find out what the good teachers do and we will do that not by looking at their syllabus, not by giving them teacher training, uh, we }{\*\bkmkstart ldl27101}{\*\bkmkend ldl27101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}have to look at their graduates.  We have to say how good are the people coming out of that class \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  \line \tab       So, I would love, and I am advocate I am going to stand here and swear to you I will defend any system that allows any person }{\*\bkmkstart ldl27151}{\*\bkmkend ldl27151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}who wants to, to go out and teach permaculture anywhere, because it would be such a shame if we put the brakes on motivation and ability and passion.  I will also defend the case it's in universities with a good curriculum to teach those others who appreciate }{\*\bkmkstart ldl27201}{\*\bkmkend ldl27201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}formal education, but\~I stand with non formal education of anyone who wants to get out there, do it, make a film, talk to your local society.

Now, those teachers taught teachers.  You see the yellow spreading, who taught teachers, who taught teachers.  Exponentially, permaculture has moved acrossed the world really because of teachers who taught teachers.  Now, they didn't all do it with certificates and courses and we'll talk about that in a minute.  Now, what happened then is some people got, I've\~got some notes here I'm not sticking to them - \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} - were the designers and doers and they did it and without that we teachers would have been lost, we had to go home and do it ourselves, we couldn't say hey you guys do this, we can't show what it looks like, I've not actually done it myself but my friends say... we would lose credibility.  So we had to have those models on the grand and we have to thank all those guard necessary and people who went home and established permaculture in their yards.  Ok. \line \tab       Then we have the people who settled and they explored topics.  So we had the people who started GEN, the global echo logical network, the people who started Transition Towns and we heard from Rob this morning, they made little nodes that floated off and became independent.  What we have is all this progeny of permaculture and then you have the food forest one, today in America there is a huge conference on resilient communities, but we're the ones, didn't we, we know the ones about resilience.  They have taken it and run with it.  So various people grab it and run through permaculture and feed it out there. \line \tab       Then we find economics is being a new node.  Though these people then create their own teachers and their own networks.  It's sort of what Vala was saying, we are feeding into everywhere, there seems to be no place in\~the world that we haven't moved into.  If you look at the schools network, they all have their own conferences, urban regeneration has their conferences.  You know, they are starting, it's really creating progeny everywhere.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}aside - how long have I got...?  }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} I'm just getting started really!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  I'm going to move on then.

People just pick up.  So we are going to tap into those. \line \tab       I wanted to talk to you about people doing new frontiers, accept I'm not going to because I've not got enough time.  Look at Naomi Klein meeting with Lis, can you see what the conference is about, how would you feel about being part of that movement?!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line \tab       Festival of dangerous ideas, that's what we have been doing here in many of the workshops.  Let's just go quickly to Cambodia where I want to talk about in filtration.  Quarter of the population slaughtered by Pol Pot, slim, over worked, when I went to Cambodia, it was a disaster, }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}newly}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} formed government, departments like rural affairs, agriculture, women's affairs, they didn't know what to do they had never held those jobs.  They had no brief the department didn't know.  The government didn't know.  It was hopeless.  So when they invited me to do permaculture in Persat, suddenly they had a brief and we had infiltrated into a government department.  I trained the first trainers, I trained them in permaculture, I went back, I monitored, went from village to village, looking at food increase, decrease in waste, in crease in money.  Often just a dollar a week was enough to send a child to school, and a dollar a month would get a enough rice.  Tiny increases in people's prosperity, but they could do it themselves, it became a people's movement.  So the department of women's affairs went out to every village and they stood there in the dirt and under houses and taught people to do permaculture, but not until they had learned it themselves.  Then the people learning had to come and look at the gardens of the trainers.  The whole thing was embedded into in-service training and salaries not a new NGO, not a model farm just right through.  The same thing happened in Uganda with the department of agriculture, same with South-West Ethiopia, it's happened through Permatil in East Timor, custom gardens in the Solomons, putting things in place already existing and }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:25001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}infiltrate and give people that knowledge, which is my second passion, the right\~to good, reliable knowledge and evidence.  People in the Solomon Islands, couldn't assist whether the ocean was rising or not and whether they would get another tsunami, terrible.  So what we have done is try to get them information about the situation the way we have had here, but also information on how to move forward.  So, that information has enabled.  I would like us now to just stop for a moment and think of those thousands, tens of thousands of permaculturists in Cambodia, Africa, Vietnam, India who can't be here today because they are the farmers on the ground practising permaculture.  If I could I would get every single one of them a certificate, they are absolutely worthy and they are our silent majority of permaculturists.  We are the tiny minority \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

When I arrived they hated, it they had them all lined up chipping with a big hoe, a heavy hoe chipping the weeds, at the same time the local department of agriculture said we didn't know when the local general said you must do sustainability, we didn't know, but now we know. \line \tab       I'm going to finish in just a second, this is something close to my heart, this is Constantina in Greece, she spent 12 - 18 months translating this book into Greek, she wanted people to have the knowledge and materials in their own language, she doesn't want them being told this is true or that's true.

I found, I've got a small sort of brain and I had trouble reading bill's book and keeping it together and so I wrote an easy one for me and then it got published.  Then the second one about teaching is for teachers that want good material and it's thoroughly resourced, this is for teaching permaculture teachers.  I wanted to do it because I wanted to teach with a sense of care of people, not as curriculum, but process.  If we teach as if people matter as a process, we actually don't need a curriculum.  Treat people well.  Listen to them.  Listen to opinions, hear what they have got to say.  So that is free, online to any of you here, I think, because I haven't looked!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  But it was crowd-funders who gave that.

I think you are vitally needed.  If our cities had five billion people by 2050, how good are we to offer cities fabulous resources, I don't think we are there, but permaculture shows we can be there and very quickly.  We have more than 30 years to skill-up and get good at cities, we have lots of strategies, lots of techniques, we can look to Hong Kong with their brilliant, small-scale work, we can look to the roof gardens and the balcony gardeners, we have got lots we just need to put it together. \line \tab       Refugees, I would be stoked if we good develop a lovely way to work with people going into camps.  I've worked in refugee camps in the past }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:26001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and they see the need for permaculture and yet their resourceful, they have got lives, they have got grateful to be there.  They are some of the most wonderful people you will ever meet.  Friend of mine was in deep depression, terrible depression, until he started to work with refugees and he said, "This is great", not because he was helping, but because of what they give to us.  It's a great generosity of refugees, so karin in the last course lives in Spain, she said, "I want to go to developing countries and too what you too", and I said, the developing countries are coming here and so are the developed countries!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  She said, "I could go to the coast, not far from our ecosystem, see if people want to come up here and look and talk to us and share their skills", go for it Karin, no qualification, no world body.  Right.  So how will we do it?  I think you can answer these questions, it's all right the succession, we have got one example from India, we had a fab example this morning for the YouGen, how to use mass media and mass movements and get it right.  We have to move into the future with more visuals that puts me out...!  We have to establish quality of trainees we have to enable, enable, adapt. \line \tab       Right, I've finished with this.  In Kabul, where the war has gone now since 1978, there is a group of young people called the Afghan peace volunteers and they are 50 people, mainly orphans and internal refugees living in a little house they got in touch with me and said, "We want to learn permaculture."  Now they had no land and they had nothing to teach them and no books and Kabul is being bombed and so this is the rooftop of a girls' hostel and we have been meeting when we can, because there is no reliable web access, on Skype and couple of them have actually died in time since we started through landmines, bombs.  They live probably in fear, like people in Syria and they said, "We'll do a garden."  It's a beautiful permaculture garden.  They said, "Enough war, our journey to peace, we want permaculture."  They are seeking support.  So 50 young Afghanis, partly permaculturists, it takes some getting your head around, they have not got anything, no families, no resources, they just believe it's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl27301}{\*\bkmkend ldl27301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}enough.

So, just going to wrap this up.  Yeah, just a few last comments I want to say a little bit about the permaculture association what we're going to do next, and a little }{\*\bkmkstart ldl29601}{\*\bkmkend ldl29601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}wider call to action, and some thanks.  Briefly.  \line \tab       So, we have spent the last 12 months really focused on this IPC at the permaculture association an amazing team of people, staff and volunteers.  We have learnt a huge amount doing this }{\*\bkmkstart ldl29651}{\*\bkmkend ldl29651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we have really built our capacity and in parallel to that we have also been planning a really ambitious new programme of learning, research of network development.  Two things I would like to highlight now, are the kind of things we can do which we wouldn't have done if we }{\*\bkmkstart ldl29701}{\*\bkmkend ldl29701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}had not had this IPC.  To try to become, it more strategic in our contributions to wider world.  \line \tab       So one we want to develop more conferences, we have done convergences but we want to develop some more conferences, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl29751}{\*\bkmkend ldl29751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}not yet but \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} soon, and want\~to explore some really key issues in Britain.  Thinking from a permaculture perspective, what is\~the kind of Britain that we want and need.  So, we have done the world, designing the world we want now let's do designing the Britain }{\*\bkmkstart ldl29801}{\*\bkmkend ldl29801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we want.  We'll do that over a series of events, culminating over a three or four year period, in\~a big conference.  In parallel to that we want to development, I don't\~know if manifesto is too strong a term but something like a manifesto that sets }{\*\bkmkstart ldl29851}{\*\bkmkend ldl29851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}out how we think we need\~to\~progress Britain.  How do we make Britain a really genuinely sustainable, equitable, socially just, fair, nice, happy place to be.  \line \tab       We're not setting up a party although we will be the best party in town we }{\*\bkmkstart ldl29901}{\*\bkmkend ldl29901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}want\~to make contribution to other organisation NGOs, political parties can look\~at and consider when they are formulating their own policies.  We want to set out a really bold strategy for making the Britain we want.  \line \tab       In terms of a kind of wider call }{\*\bkmkstart ldl29951}{\*\bkmkend ldl29951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to action, it's interesting, here we are in the Quaker's Friends Meetings House, very fine tradition the Quakers have of making change in the world from a really ethical place.  If you walk just maybe 150, 200 metres }{\*\bkmkstart ldl30001}{\*\bkmkend ldl30001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}from here into Russell Square there is a beautiful statute of Gandhi.  I am going\~to horribly paraphrase the Quakers and Gandhi now and say something along the lines of two things I think are really important.  \line \tab       We need that kind of local action, there's nothing }{\*\bkmkstart ldl30051}{\*\bkmkend ldl30051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}more local than us, we need to be the change, we have been here we have been inspired, what it's we can take away, and put into practice in our own lives.  One call to action is make it personal.  \line \tab       How can each one of us, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl30102}{\*\bkmkend ldl30102}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}be that change.  The second thing is, again somewhere between Quakers and Gandhi is speak truth unto power, and bear witness.  We cannot really just \uc1\u8216\'91la-la-la\uc1\u8217\'92 while the steamroller keeps moving on.  We have to say what is acceptable }{\*\bkmkstart ldl30151}{\*\bkmkend ldl30151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and what is not acceptable.  There\~are many things happening at the moment which are utterly unacceptable.  Not only do we have to set a fantastic example of what can be amazing, we also need to hold people to account.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  \line \tab       The refugee crisis, all the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl30201}{\*\bkmkend ldl30201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}different things we\~have talked about, that is not the world we want.  So let's say clearly what it is that we do want, and hold people to account.  \line \tab       So we're only going to do that by collaborating, collaborating like crazy as if our lives }{\*\bkmkstart ldl30251}{\*\bkmkend ldl30251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}depended on it because they really do.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  Without that collaboration we have got no chance of an ecological or ethical future, we need each other.  \line \tab       Ok.

We }{\*\bkmkstart ldl30302}{\*\bkmkend ldl30302}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}have tried to put the sponsor message up quite a\~lot because we really have had great support from them, not just financially but actually financial thing has not been the big thing, it's been more the support we have\~got from people.

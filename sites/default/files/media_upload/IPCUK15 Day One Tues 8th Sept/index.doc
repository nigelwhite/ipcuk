So we like to start off normally with a big welcome, so welcome to London.  You want to welcome somebody you don't know, so turn to somebody you don't know, so look around the room.  I know people that know each other so I will come and get you.  So three questions, they'll come up at some point.  So, what is your name.  Where you are from.  What brought you here today.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}chatter in the room}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}.  So just in case you use Twitter, the hashtag is #IPCUK.... \line ANDY GOLDRING:  Calling Stefan Geyer. \line STEFAN GEYER:  Ok, so as the hubbub slowly turns it's volume down, end your sentence, end your last word, and a hush fills the room... then everybody knows from the outside to also come in. \line \tab       So, again, good morning welcome everyone, I'm going to hand over to our Chief Executive Andy Goldring \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line ANDY GOLDRING:  Very wonderful to see you all.  Welcome to the 12th International Permaculture Conference \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}.  For some of us this is the beginning of a ten day marvellous adventure, for some of you just here for a day or two days you are all very welcome.  We have people here from 70 countries \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}.  Which is fantastic, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:1001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a really truly, international event.

We are going to highlight the inspiring, far-sighted projects of today, that show us what a sustainable society could and we hope will, look like in the future.  But before we go to our speakers, I'm going to do some quick housekeeping.  So first of all for all you sort of Twitter, it's@ British Quakers, there is no planned fire alarm, if it does go please follow the green signs and stewards will direct you to the nearest assembly points.  Have a look through your programme and choose your sessions in advance, we suggest you have a second choice.  There is a lot on, so, yeah.  Try and work something out before you go.  Importantly, there are many people here for whom English is their second language and we want to make sure that this conference is good for them as well, so we have the wonderful support of these Palantypists and we also have a system for support, so if you speak other languages and you would like to sign up, there is a timetable where you can do so in the small hall.  There are a number of changes to the programme.  You always have to print this in advance, it never quite works out.  So, I've just, I'll just say there is an errata sheet which you will have, with the poem on the back.  The ones I want to highlight just now are that Amelia and Cat Walls workshop, enabling change is today in the morning in room 5 rather than Wednesday, Alice tailor has unfortunately had to cancel her workshop, 'In your backyard', Permaculture culture into business reality workshop is in room 4, that's today.  The eco-system of community action is in room 6.  So it's all on your sheet, I want to draw your attention to that.  Lunch and break time drinks in be in the Endersleigh and Bloomsbury speech and dotted around the building, we have stalls from sponsors and other friends and we very much encourage you to go and have a look at what they have got to show you.  If you have a special diet and you have told us in advance, then your food will be on the ground floor and it will be very clearly marked.  Ok, at conferences we know, some people are introverted, some are extrovert we are all different, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:1502"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we have given you an official question to talk to anyone you like.  We have 'Lunch time question', which is today: what this greatest hope for the future.  You can go up to anyone and say, what's your greatest hope for the future. \line \tab       Ok if you need help, ask a steward, they have a green lanyard, don't ask me.  If you would like to join us for the Alara Gala and you haven't already booked you can do so at lunch at the Euston road entrance, there is a reception there. \line \tab       Alara is an echo business, a whole food business.  They are a member of the Permaculture Association land network, they have a fantastic forest garden it's a relatively short walk from here, you will get a glass of elderflower champagne and most importantly, music from Incredible Vegetable Sound System, has anyone here been to see Incredible Vegetable Sound System before, would you recommend it?  Yeah, thought so.  So if you haven't booked yet please go to do so before lunch. \line \tab       Questions, we have kind of decided against asking questions at the end of the plenary, we find it can be a frustrating process, not everyone gets their questions asked, somebody else spends 15 minutes telling you something and not asking a question, we're not going to do that.  The speakers will be around and will be happy to talk to you in the break.  We will have a plenary tomorrow, if you have a question you want to ask come and tell me and I'll write it Dan and I'll pick some to ask in the plenary.  Just come and talk to me even you are using Twitter we are using # Design your world.  Please turn your phone to silent if you could. \line \tab       Talking about silence, maybe we should start with a pause.  This is the home of the British Quakers and they find great power in silence.  So, let's just take a moment to stop and think.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}pause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}.  Thank you.  Ok.  So, there is absolutely no doubt that we are at a critical point in history.  This conference is one of many conferences this year, last year, all asking a similar question, how can we change the story, how do we live differently.  How do we step up to the challenge, the huge challenge that we face.  Challenges.  Multiple.  The refugee crisis in our minds at the moment, just\~one of so many different challenges that we face.  As stated in \~'transforming our world', the 2030 agenda for sustaining are development, setting out the new sustainable development goals which every government will sign that end of this }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}month}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, it says, "The future of humanity and our planet lies }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:2001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in our hands.  It will be for all of us to ensure that the journey is successful."  Today and tomorrow we are going to work are hardest to make sure that journey is successful. \line \tab       It seems that people are desperate for solutions, well we have them, or at the very least we have a way of thinking about how we can bring them together with each other.  We have got this sort of participatory design approach, solutions-focused method of engage people, looking at skills and resources we have got and making a difference.  We think that Permaculture plus the many other sustainability initiatives and sustainability focused organisations, together can make a really major contribution to actually delivering these sustainable development goals and help design the world we want, but the changes we need are not just technical, they are cultural too.  We need a cultural shift.  So we thought it made sense to start with a poem.  I'm going to hand over now to Shiobhan who will read us some poems. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

Let us grieve for the broken body of our earth.  For the pillage devastation of our despair crying out in agony, her legs splayed open wide and all her treasure plundered.  Let us cover are naked bodies in the ashes of our dead and weeping, kneel upon this blessed earth, sending up a great lament, imploring her forgiveness for this is our body, this is our blood, only we have forgotten.  We have forgotten the place where prayer opens softly in the darkness of the body, humming with sweetness.  The place where every cell and fibre of our beings is ringing out an Angelus, an hallelujah, chorus.  Let us remember the deep well of our belonging, the holy mystery of our lives and let us dream a new world into being.  Let us dream a new world into being for there is a place, older than this one, where the body keeps a gentle harmony to the soul's steady beat, to the deep thrum, thrum, thrumming of the land, to the waltzing, whooshing of the waves, to the rhythmic moaning of the tides.  There is another place, not far from here, where the soul entwines with the body in the rapturous elegance of embrace, singing a forgotten melody, resonating without a hitch in perfect, perfect pitch.  There is another place not far from here we used to call home.  So let us remember the deep well of our belonging, the holy mystery of our lives and let us dream a new world into being.  Let us dream a new world into being.

So come and find me and we will create a big group conference poem, a bit like this, with coloured paper, long sheets of brown paper and present it at the end.  I'm hoping there will be some people here who will like to come and read the conference poem on the last day and perhaps to translate a small bit of it into your own languages, so we'll have a tapestry of language from around the world.  There is also a poetry film made from the poem 'Forgotten memory' in your packs, we're hoping to show that in Room 2 at lunch time, in ten different languages from around the world, grieving for are world.

I am doctor Chris Warburton-Brown I am the research co-ordinator of the Permaculture Association Britain.  \line \tab       Last week I\~was talking to a friend about coming to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl351}{\*\bkmkend ldl351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}this conference, and he asked me how\~many people were coming I said over 600.  Then he asked me how\~many of those I had met before, I said well about 40.  Then it just struck me, there\~are 5 and plus people in this room who I }{\*\bkmkstart ldl401}{\*\bkmkend ldl401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}am now meeting for the first time, so hello everyone \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} that's true for everybody here.  Nobody in this room I\~think knows even half of\~the other people here and there will be some people here who know absolutely nobody else in this room and will be meeting everybody for the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl451}{\*\bkmkend ldl451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}first time.  \line \tab       So over the next 2 days we're going to have an amazing time as we learn from each other, build friendships and network.  In this room we have\~got Christopher Nesbitt who works to restore degraded soil in Belize, and }{\*\bkmkstart ldl501}{\*\bkmkend ldl501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Joel Williams who works to restore degrade soil in\~the UK.  They have never met before, hopefully they will meet over the these 2 days and have some amazing conversation.  Hopefully that will be multiplied over and over again.  Wouldn't it be brilliant if we can }{\*\bkmkstart ldl551}{\*\bkmkend ldl551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}keep P the conversation going after the conference is finished.  If we could continue\~to share expertise in our experience to ask each other the questions we want answered.  That's what we want to do with the Permaculture International Research Network, we want to create and\~on line network of conversation }{\*\bkmkstart ldl601}{\*\bkmkend ldl601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of knowledge sharing of question asking.  We want to find out what we already know within the permaculture community and find out what we don't know yet but still want to discover next.  Everything it does will\~be focused on 2 simple aims, improving the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl651}{\*\bkmkend ldl651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}practice of permaculture by permaculture health practitioners and building an evidence-base to show that's what we really do works.  It's incredible, PIRN, I we hope you all join us in making that vision a reality having explained our vision in will hand over to cat to explain }{\*\bkmkstart ldl701}{\*\bkmkend ldl701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}how we're going to deliver it.  \line CAT RICHARDS: Thank you Chris.  So, now Chris has outlined are vision you maybe one wondering how we propose to deliver it in 2012 the Permaculture Association Britain started a series of surveys which witch we observe and interacted with researcher) }{\*\bkmkstart ldl752}{\*\bkmkend ldl752}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and health practitioners all over world many of yourselves clued.  We found that almost everyone was enthusiastic banned online network where they could pursue their research interests within a supported community.  You asked us for a network with many yields, from\~the more obvious sharing of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl801}{\*\bkmkend ldl801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}research, to those of building community, guidance on research methodologies, making friends, and possibly even enjoying ourselves at the same time.  \line \tab       One of\~the findings from the surveys that was most surprising was the massive diversity of both permaculture practice and research.  By }{\*\bkmkstart ldl852}{\*\bkmkend ldl852}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}building an international research network we hope to encourage this diversity as well as the diversity of geography, research topics and approaches.  \line \tab       This diversity of research patterns will shape how members use the site to self-organise, so we're going to build it in\~a simple }{\*\bkmkstart ldl901}{\*\bkmkend ldl901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}way so people can find each other along the lines of discipline, location and climate.  This could be quite challenging as we have over 400 members in 50 countries, as you can see.  \line \tab       In particular, we would like\~to create a live feed }{\*\bkmkstart ldl951}{\*\bkmkend ldl951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of research that participants might be interested in, to help to exploit the productive edges of the diversity of interests approach S and disciplines.  We're hoping we can catch and store some of\~the excitement, energy and motivation from this conference to kick start the network to reap }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1001}{\*\bkmkend ldl1001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the rewards of improved permaculture practice and robust evidence base far into the future.

Are you there David?  How is it in Melliodora, let's see.

Of\~course, although\~I have been a critic of\~the down sides of fossil fuel globalisation, I really experience it as a privilege of\~the current era that I can contribute to the global meeting from a small village that might seem at the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1401}{\*\bkmkend ldl1401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}end of the earth, at least from the perspective in London.  \line \tab       Yes, I wanted to reflect on how understanding the ebb and flow in the adoption of permaculture, and it's spread over the last 40 years, can inform our plans with permaculture in the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1451}{\*\bkmkend ldl1451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}future and a future full of challenges that can be turned into opportunities.  \line \tab       The waves of adoption and spread of permaculture over the last 40 years have been strongly correlated with large-scale geopolitical and economic cycles and events.  It's interesting that permaculture 1 }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1501}{\*\bkmkend ldl1501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}was published in 1978, bracketed between the oil crisis of 1973, and 79, and strongly informed by the limits to growth work which was published by the club of Rome in 1972.  \line \tab       So there\~was a }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1551}{\*\bkmkend ldl1551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}huge interest in what today we would call sustainability and I am very certain that if permaculture 1 was published in a decade later, there mat might not have been the same interest.  Certainly, I date the end of that first wave as being 1983, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1603}{\*\bkmkend ldl1603}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}when the Government introduced the Thatcher, Reagan revolution with a bit of a human face in Australia, but a whole generation of environmental activists came to conclusion that the limits of resources was not going to lead to a fundamental change in society.  There\~was }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1651}{\*\bkmkend ldl1651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}actually a consolidation period during that time in the interests in permaculture, it didn't expand very rapidly as the western economies again grew.  Now the second wave I really relate to the stock market crash of 87 and IPCC being formed in 88 }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1702}{\*\bkmkend ldl1702}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}with recognition of climate change.  That was the same year that the designers manual was published.  A huge explosion in Australia and many other countries round the world.  Ironically I date the end of that second wave of being the Rio earth summit of 1992, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1752}{\*\bkmkend ldl1752}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}which so many people put so much hope in.  \line \tab       By the late 1990s, I sensed a third wave, which had both the oppositional sides and the negative - the positive sides as well.  My book Brings and Pathways beyond }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1801}{\*\bkmkend ldl1801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Sustainability published in 2002 coincided with that, but it\~was still born by the events of September 11th.  Really it took to the GFC where we see this fourth wave which is now unfolding with after the peaking of conventional }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1851}{\*\bkmkend ldl1851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}oil the onset of real climate change and economic contraction.  So this history suggests that the future form of permaculture will\~be shaped more by these forces than the desires and plans of individuals or organisations.  So, as the\~limits to growth crisis }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1901}{\*\bkmkend ldl1901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is unfolding the transition to renewable energy form, if that transition fires the energy transition of\~the past the last 250 years to higher quality, denser more reliable energy than I predict that permaculture will remain as an ethical or lifestyle choice of\~a minority in\~a }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1951}{\*\bkmkend ldl1951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}conflicted but materially abundant world.  \line \tab       Now on\~the other hand, if the renewable future is one of energy descent that I have described, then permaculture in principle if not name will become normalised, adaptive behaviour for rediscovering our place in nature. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2001}{\*\bkmkend ldl2001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\line \tab       So we might all have strong opinions about, and hopes and fears, about possible futures and how to shape them, but the necessary transformation I believe is as much an internal process as an external one.  I\~think seeing energy descent as an opportunity }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2051}{\*\bkmkend ldl2051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}rather than a problem, might just be the largest and most significant contribution of permaculture thinking to a prosperous way down for humanity.

We are kind of sandwiched between two very inhospitable worlds, Venus on the inside, nearer the sun, where the run away greenhouse effect has left it hot enough to melt lead at the surface of the planet, this is pretty much the only photograph we have of the surface of Venus, pretty much before the probe melted essentially.  On the outside, further from the sun is Mars, a cold, arid wasteland, it looks superficially like parts of the earth, but the red colour in the sky specially gives it away.  I say superficially like parts of the earth... let's see if this works, that's the Atacama Desert, that's on the earth, it's the driest place on the surface of the earth, the blue in the sky gives away the fact we have a nitrogen rich atmosphere, most of the earth is abundant with liquid and life.  I'm going to tell you a story about the history of the earth to talk you through some of the pivotal changes that have happened to change our world from something that started in the same way as Mars and Venus into the flourishing place it is today.  Centre to the story are three key revolutionary events, each of them is driven by, essentially a revolution, a rare and special one that increases the energy and material flows through the whole biosphere that cause changes in the planet and climate, each of the revolutions is dependent on the previous one, we needed all of them to happen for us to be here and have this conversation today.  Don't worry we will come to the future that end \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line \tab       Timescales are so enormous they are hard to get your head around with earth history, 4 and a half million years.  So each of your heart beats actually lasted a year and you were to live to 100 years old, when you are a hundred looking back your life span then is equivalent to the four and a half million years of earth history, as we go through I may try to refer to the earth on that kind of human }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:3501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}timescale. \line \tab       So, the earth was born with the rest of the solar system four and a half million years ago, round a sun fainter than today, giving out about 30% less light, the earth formed from the collision of rocks, the spinning dust and matter around the early sun, one of the early collisions with a Mars-size planetesimal we all it, when the moon started life it was much closer to the earth and as you will see there, but we now know that the earth gained its liquid water very early, partly out-gassed from interior of the young planet, a haphazard process, the early earth with liquid water was getting pummelled from rocks from space if life did begin it would be sterilised, some of the impacts could evaporate the whole oceans, the heavy bombardment left the craters we see on the moon day-to-day that ends in real time about 3.8 million years ago, or kind of in the teenage years if the, if the earth is a 100-year old person.  Remarkably soon after the end of this pummelling with rocks, we have the first convincing evidence for life on the planet, it's the origin of life and then the origin of a global biosphere of recycling elements which is the first revolution in the earth's history.  The origin of life is difficult but it did happen as soon as it could on the earth, our records of it are a little scant but we have remarkable evidence, this is for three and a quarter million years ago, this is early bacterial cells, fossils in the act of cell division, peered at down the microscope there, a remarkable image of some of our earliest ancestors, we know the early cells, this is a world entirely of bacteria were forming communities, were making physical structures, just as these microbial maps in shark bay in Australia are still doing today.  We find the rock record equivalence of these structures, we call them stromatolites in the fossil record, crucially life needs an energy sources as well as materials, instead of the familiar photosynthesis we know now, there were earlier forms of photosynthesis that used gases like hydrogen, they are pretty rare in today's world and would have been rare back then, it was limited initially by the supply of those kind of rare and reactive gases, the trick that early life must have pulled off was to evolve ways }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:4001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of recycling all the materials it needed to build itself or build the early biosphere including that hydrogen, gas, we still have organisms forming, performing the early form of photosynthesis, that origin or recycling and the consequent changes in world's chemistry including an early warm climate that kind of marked the first revolution.  Artists can draw impressions of this world, it's known as the Archean World, as in 'In the beginning', it was a world thriving with life, not as productive as the biosphere that we have now, the estimates are 100 of today's productivity, the }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}next}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} thing is the oxygen revolution, that's kind of in middle age, incredibly, it takes a long, long time, until about 2.7 million years ago, something like 40 years old in the life of this 100-year old planet, person, before the first so-called sign of bacteria evolve.  These are the first organisms that performed the kind of photosynthesis we are all familiar with, that means it uses water, basically as the sort of electrons that will stick on the carbon dioxide and make it's body, these are the modern bacteria, they also fix nitrogen, these guys, they are pretty smart and }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}into}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} amazing chemical things, they're earliest ancestors we date back now maybe 2.7 million years, this no innovation was important, once you are using water for photosynthesis, you are not limited on this planet, the biosphere went up possibly 100, possibly 1000 followed, these little guys put out oxygen as a waste product that ultimately accumulates in the atmosphere.  There are some interesting dynamics that I will not baffle you with scientifically, the oxygen level doesn\uc1\u8217\'92t rise immediately, a few hundred million years where there is stable oxygen, then an abrupt change that chemists call the great oxidation, it's a radical rise in the oxygen content from like 100,000 from today to a 10th, still not another for you and I to breath, but we will see it has important consequences, also important geological consequences, that southern African beds of rusted iron, these were produced at the time of that great oxidation, this rise of oxygen completely overturns the earth's chemistry, it leads to problems with the climate, again in earth's middle age we see some evidence that there was a very cold spell where glaciers and sea ice reached down and created the called snowball earth where it was frozen over, life got through that or we wouldn't be here to talk about it.  In }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:4502"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}fact stability is re-established by a couple of billion years ago.  Earth is still in middle age, if you like. \line \tab       Then we come to the third and final pivotal revolution in earth history.  Which I'm calling the complexity revolution.  This one is a bit of a slow burner, because it has to, it starts with the origin of complex cells that you, I, fungi and plants are made, in the more oxygen rich world, created by the bacteria, there is now more chemical energy around for life.  That is sometimes linked to the origin of the first complex cells.  These are roughly 2cm across, the size of a 2p piece, some of the first fossil evidence for the first ancestors.  They are about 1.8 billion years old those ones.  There is a well-known textbook biology story of how the cells are formed, the essence is they are a fusion of previous freely having bacteria, so they are a remarkable evolutionary fusion which is so improbable and rare that's it's only happened once in the four and a half billion year history of the earth there is some acquisition of bacteria, to form the first allergy.  We don't know when it happened, it may be around 2 billion years }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}ago}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} yet there then is not a lot happening in the earth's 50's and 60's if you like into old age, there is an interval that is called the boring billion, there is so little happening in the record, we begin to see the first seaweed, little allergy fossils, 2 billion years ago, something about the low oxygen levels, maybe, toxic air was slowing the revolution of life, the first ancestors of some kind of animal, sponges, starting to appear 750 million years ago and then, kind all hell breaks loose, we have another couple of snowball earth events and somehow these ancestors of complex life, these early sponges get through them with everything else and then in the aftermath of the snowball earth, we know that the oceans became oxygen for the first time, there is a rise in oxygen in the atmosphere or an increase in nutrients, out of turmoil of snowball earth comes the first fossil evidence of large complex life forms.  You can probably just about make them out, there is a couple of different species if you line, fossil fronds, about 20cm long, possibly the first more complex animal life forms on the planet, around 600m years ago, well before the famous Cambrian explosion, we are still debating what sort of life form they are.  For the next }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:5001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}couple of hundred million years complex life got going in the ocean, until by 450m years ago, which is when earth 100-year old is about 90 already, we have finally the colonisation of the land by plants.  With that, a kind of doubling of the global productivity of the biosphere, oxygen at modern levels and the establishment of the familiar complex Gaia with recycling of nutrients on language as well as in the ocean.  If we were to look back over those very quickly sketched revolutions in our history, those revolutions that, if you think of it this way are required for us to be here at all to make the oxygen-rich atmosphere that we need to breath and the stable climate we enjoy.  We can review this.  }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

We are very, very, very recent arrivals in this long history.  If we went with my lifespan of hundred, compressing earth's history into that of a hundred year old person then homo sapiens}{\*\bkmkstart ldl2351}{\*\bkmkend ldl2351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} are arriving about a week ago, certainly that recent.  We have caused a\~lot of trouble since then, but just ask the question could we possibly fulfil the criteria to be the agents of another revolutionary change of our planet earth system or Gaia if you prefer.  I\~think }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2402}{\*\bkmkend ldl2402}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}it's conceivable.  We meet all these conditions, we have, there\~is an unusual biological innovation in our history, that people are still scientists still trying to understand but we have an extraordinary language or communication faculty that we don't see in any other organism. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2451}{\*\bkmkend ldl2451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}We all share an apparently genetically encoded natural language capable, including deaf mute people that evolve sign\~language that have the same universal grammar, so something special about our communication ability as well as are opposable and general technological creatively has allowed us\~to change the world.  By }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2502}{\*\bkmkend ldl2502}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}10,000 years ago, - having a few battery troubles, it couldn\uc1\u8217\'92t be a very big picture in our city perhaps little dated artist impression of\~the agriculture origin the neolithic revolution.  As the last ice age is ending we find ways of more efficiently tapping }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2551}{\*\bkmkend ldl2551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}solar energy, boosting the energy input to\~our societies, but still through good solar energy capture by plants, but that allows essentially the rise of the first civilisation, like this one of the cities ancient cities from modern day Iraq that was thriving 6,000 years ago, this }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2601}{\*\bkmkend ldl2601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}represent a new level of complexity in life of biology that not been seen before, the city state with division of labour aim is fundraised that includes an army to go out and fight off other city states. You can\~get to 400 years ago the Dutch Golden Age we're still }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2651}{\*\bkmkend ldl2651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}running our civilisation and trying to advance it on solar energy, captured by plants into biomass either that we eat as food or burn to heat our homes or try to start industry.  That was fundamentally limited system, but as we all know, something called the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2701}{\*\bkmkend ldl2701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}industrial revolution happened.  This is James Watson's model of\~a new common steam engine which he\~was using to try to work out a more efficient steam energy which he duly did, it played a pivotal role in the industrial revolution, which of\~course is about fossil fuels but }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2751}{\*\bkmkend ldl2751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}it's all about these new technologies and almost a new kind of social model that in England at least, exploded through positive feedback to self-propel and extraordinary change immaterial and energy consumption that we're still kind of feeling our way through, and is still ramping }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2801}{\*\bkmkend ldl2801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}up so itself evident that as a species we have already transformed the energy and material flows in the biosphere.  We have more than doubled, probably trebled the done the same thing to nitrogen and having the same affect on\~the cycle.  We're meeting all\~the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2851}{\*\bkmkend ldl2851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}criteria to be the agencies of revolutionary change when you see it as good or bad \line \tab       The final one is whether the earth is prone to instability.  Here's a trace from an Antarctic ice core of\~the last 6,000 years, this measure in white of\~the temperature, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2901}{\*\bkmkend ldl2901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in blue of\~the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, they go in lock step, we have these ice ages, and warm in between them, this amazing sawtooth oscillation of the whole climate of our ancestors down here.  If we take the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2951}{\*\bkmkend ldl2951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}numbers and scales off this plot?  Showed it to a cardiologist and ask them how healthy the patient was or an electrical engineer, how stable is\~the output, they would say no, this a classic case of\~a system that's verging of instability the positive feedbacks in }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3001}{\*\bkmkend ldl3001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}this system are starting\~to take over from the negative feedback and damning self-regulating process.

In short the earth is unusually unstable at the moment, just at the time that we evolve, have are various revolution, specially the industrial one and start pumping up the CO 2 levels, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3102}{\*\bkmkend ldl3102}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}now to 400 parts per million, and escalating all\~the time.  \line \tab       Now we have there, all the kind of ingredients that could make us agents of a fundamental transformation of this planet, this Gaia, this earth system, so where are }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3151}{\*\bkmkend ldl3151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we going so of\~course the dominant cultural narrative I find, maybe I am influenced by pessimist, seems to be one of Apocalypse, this not going to end well.  This S an image from the movie fantastic book The Road, I have spent }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3201}{\*\bkmkend ldl3201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}much of the last 10 years busy in my office, plotting out what are the potential\~tipping points that we might trigger I feel like one of\~the people of\~the Apocalypse a\~lot of the time, I know we could trigger fundamental jumps changes abrupt shifts in the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3251}{\*\bkmkend ldl3251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}earth dynamics so the threat or the risk is real that we are changing the world.  One response to that is a very natural one and one I have kind of been part of and waving the placards myself through my life is\~to say let's retreat.  I\~think }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3302}{\*\bkmkend ldl3302}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we heard that from David Holmgren a minute ago, let's rain in our energy use and our material consumption and find new more equitable, lower impact state on\~the planet.  That's all very well, but\~I\~am going to differ because flies in the face of all\~the trends }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3351}{\*\bkmkend ldl3351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that have unfolded in my lifetime and are unfolding now, energy use still escalating, population said\~to stabilise mid-century, but we can't pull the rug of energy and material supply from underneath what are down to be 9 or 10 billion people on this planet }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3401}{\*\bkmkend ldl3401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}quite soon in my and your lifetime.  So it\~may\~be that we're thinking about the fact that energy is not a bad thing fundamentally, it's just how you source it.  I\~think this a possibility that we can be the agencies of a positive revolutionary change for }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3451}{\*\bkmkend ldl3451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}our planet that's positive for us, and is works for the rest of\~the biosphere.  Now that's going\~to have to be supplied or fuelled or powered by sustainable energy sores of which solar par is once again the obvious one and the biggest source of all such }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3501}{\*\bkmkend ldl3501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a big source that through our solar technology, these panels are 10 hundred times more efficient than plants in converting sunlight into electricity or usable energy.  Solar power has the potential to allow quite a\~lot of growth in energy consumption.  That would be a horror }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3551}{\*\bkmkend ldl3551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}story if we didn't also fix are relationship with material cycling, but I\~think it is possible to go into a higher level of sustainable energy use in the future, as long as we're using some of that sustainably sourced energy to be very, very efficient at }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3601}{\*\bkmkend ldl3601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}recycling all\~the materials we need to eat, to thrive, to survive, but also to thrive to build and remake all the bits and bobs of our civilisation.

It does give me the sense that we are living in this exceptional moment in history. \line \tab       Ok, so our final speaker this morning is Jonathan Porritt.  One of UK's most influential and well-known sustainability champions, his early career included campaigning with the Green Party, working with friends of the earth, before founding forum for the future where he currently works.  In a sense I kind of grew up with Jonathan, in the sense that as a young activist looking to change the world, his writing and the organisations he worked with, helped me to learn about and engage with sustainability.  Just a small number - a couple of years ago, I came across the World we Made, a story from 2050, which was a look back from the future to here and how we got through the challenges which Tim has just outlined.  So, I just knew we had to get you here.  It's with very great pleasure that I introduced Jonathan Porritt \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line JONATHAN PORRITT:  Thank you.

And the crisis in how we see ourselves as a dominant species, the dominant species on this planet.  I guess for me their work, the whole notion of Permaculture and the design principles that underlie Permaculture have been part of my evolving philosophy about what will make the world a better place for a very long time, going back to the 1970s, but they never been front of mind for me they never, as it were, shaped the advocacy that I have, although they formed it in the hinterland that we have at the back of our mind }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}our}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} spirit as it were, the things that shape us in perceptibly as we set about the work that we do, it's a huge privilege for me to be here today.  This is a wonderful event to have brought together a celebration of as\~much incredible work going on in so many countries, did you say 50... here today, yes, 70 here, incredible, 135 around the world. \line \tab       So that's the spirit in which I start this, I start from this notion of reorganising big systems in the world today.  This whole concept of design principles, just been reading a biography of Dick }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Dusselldorp}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, the chair and founder of an organisation called Lendallies, started in Australia, now a huge global company, he was a touch man, went to Australia in the 50's just after the war, ended up in a country that tried to find its way in the modern world, Australia, he looked at the building and construction basis, he came to the conclusion that the foundation of that was so flawed, there would be no ways in using the skills of the construction industry to make a better built environment. \line \tab       The reason I mention this, yes he then set about successfully to build a big global international company, he did something more remarkable, he set about to transform the operating code which under pined the success of that industry, to change the basic design principles and it took him a long time and obviously worked with lots of other people, but he looks at the really perverse, dysfunctional relationships between all the different players in the construction value chain as it were from the architects to the designers to the specifiers, those that procure the materials, the builders, financiers, planners he looks at all these elements in a very complex supply chain and reengineered the relationships between them to create opportunities for a completely different, far more }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:6001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}efficient, far more attuned approach towards construction in that country.  We have inherited a lot of that back here in the UK.  The reason why I'm mentioning this, because it seems to me that every industry, anywhere in the world, is going to have to engage in a similar process of examination, scrutiny of what it is that has allowed it to prosper up until a certain point inhumane history and to commit to a process of reengineering the basic operating code.  I don't think there is any part of our economy today that isn't going to have to do that fundamental exercise.  If you go back to that period of time after the Second World War, Tim passed over that as a fleeting nanosecond in the history of life on earth, quite rightly, but those 65 years, or 70 years since the end of the Second World War have completely shaped the presence of human kind on this planet, large because of our ability to harness, capture and use fossil fuels in the way that we have done, so 'Successfully', interesting that time.  Some experts call this the period of the great acceleration, everything exploding in terms of our use of land, natural resources, energy, the creation of wastes of every conceivable kind, the huge surge in the expectations on the part of human kind that have shaped today's consumer-based, consumer society the great acceleration captures really well what has happened in those 70 years. \line \tab       Our problem and it is a massive problem, is that most of the mindsets that now dominate today's geopolitical arena, the mindsets of our politicians, our corporate business leaders, of our commentators in the media and I have to say the mindsets of many, many people in academia, obviously not Tim's mindset as we know - \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} - but many people in academia, their mindsets are 100% shaped by their experiences in that period, that mini era of the great acceleration.  It's practically impossible for them to think about the profound redesign process that we are now going to have to go through, given that the era of the great acceleration has already ground to a halt, if not ground to a halt as yet, it shunts, that it's absolutely about to grind to a halt in the very near future. \line \tab       We are kind of stuck in an trying place, we have had this period of astonishing growth that has made human kind what it is on the earth today, that has shaped so much of the intellectual, the cognitive process that is going on in are minds the whole time, individually and collectively and we haven't yet found a way of escaping from that intellectual lock-in, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:6504"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the sense that people's minds are so profoundly shaped by that 70 year, tiny, little period of human history that we haven't yet find a way through to what lies on the other side of that.  Nowhere of course is that more true than in this whole area of food production and how we use the earth to provide us with the where with all to feed however many human beings there will be on this planet. \line \tab       Now you hear this all the time of course, this issue about food security, as its called.  How do we produce enough food for 7 billion people today and 8 billion people by the turn of century, 9 billion, maybe some people keep pushing out beyond to 10 million and so on, this lies at the heart of human insanity today, we think there is no upper level to the number of humans than can be sustained on this planet, this is not the occasion for me to let rip in terms of the I do see of today's world when it comes to population planning, take it as read that every single thing we have to do to enable human beings to live sustainably on this planet, is made harder, compounded by the fact that we can address ourselves intelligently and compassionately to the issue of really serious family planning, it won't go away, greatly hardened to the Pope having woken up to the issue of climate change, we hope the Pope will wake up to the next story about... \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} as Tim mentioned the inevitability of nine billion people, when someone says, "It's inevitable we will have 9 billion people", oh no, it can't be inevitable, it's a nightmare to contemplate that stuff.  So, put that to one side!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  . \line \tab       If you listen to politicians today talking about food security, what you will hear as the dominant light motif in their pitch is, we have to double the amount of food we need to feed the world by xx, some people will say by 2025, 2030, they all have a doubling story going on in their mind, a period of time that we have to double the amount of food we need.  Former chief scientist, Professor John Beddington, was the first man to outline the story about food security, captured through his triangle, at that time, of needing to increase the amount of energy that we need, the amount of water that we need and the amount of food that we need.  He had this great story that he sold into government ministers that this was the big challenge of our time, we had to double this by then, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:7002"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}double that by when, do all of this and this was the way that we would meet the needs of human kind.  At that time I was Chair of the sustainable development commission here in the UK, John and I had interesting exchanges along the way, I did ask him at the time that he was most active, whether it made any sense to talk about doubling the amount of food we needed without even mentioning, as a footnote, the issues of food waste and meat consumption.  He wasn't too amenable to this set of suggestions, but happily we are beginning to see things in a slightly indifferent way.  You well have noticed even the popular press, in our global media the focus on food waste as crept up and up and up, even the Daily Mail now has got the idea that it is really not very sensible to go on calling for a doubling in the amount of food production until we actually address the issue of food waste.  This issue is huge, please do not think that this is a minor irritant in the total food production system.  Depending on which analysis you read, somewhere between 30 and 45 percent of all the food that is harvested from the land never actually turns up as a nutritional input into the human body.  Somewhere between 30 and 45 percent.  Remember that much of that production system is, of course, dependant on, hugely intensive inputs, whether we are talking fertilisers, chemicals, energy, water what ever it might be.  All of that embodied energy and resource intensity is then wasted because it never does the job it was created to do, which was to provide part of a balanced diet for human kind, of a vaguely balanced }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}diet}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}. \line \tab       Actually if you wanted to double food production by 2030, by far the most intelligent starting point would be to eliminate the problems of food waste.  Now, you will never quite eliminate the problems of food waste, there are all sorts of places where food just leaks out of the system, where we can't net the full nutritional value of food at a certain point in the chain, but we could be doing so much more.  Equally, we are unlikely to address the issue of food security very intelligently, if we don't begin to confront the question of meat consumption, because right now, much of the demand for new agricultural produce is geared to using that produce as feeds for meat production. \line \tab       Right now, at the moment there is a massive expansion in the amount of soy being grow particularly in South America, we are so used to thinking about the impacts of agriculture in that continent, in terms }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:7501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of the damage to the Amazon rainforest we seem completely blind to the expansion of the soy bean industry on the other echo system which is very, very important in South America, namely the Serada, it's going on all the time, as this industry moves deeper and deeper into that space. \line \tab       I'm only using this examples of food waste and meat production to demonstrate how crazy it is to have an intelligent conversation about food production, when you can't address the critical elements in the system today.  You can't, somehow, get back to a really intelligent discussion about the core underpinning elements in food production, namely, food, soil, water, biodiversity, which are still left to one side in the current debate about food security; it must drive all of you absolutely insane to listen to these debates and know just how misplaced they still are.  Just how\~much a product of these locked-in mindsets they still are.  Yet, sometimes, if the truth be told, we are our own worst enemy in that regard.  I've been involved for a very long time as a active member of the soil association and supporter of organic farmer and other things as you would expect, I've been involved in the debate for decades about GM, genetic modification.  For me it doesn't pay a particularly big part in the future of human kind.  There may be some role for some GM story at some point in the future.  Just think about how that debate has unfolded in our midst.  Just think about the way we discuss the story of GM, GM nation, is\~the great debate that we had here in }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3801}{\*\bkmkend ldl3801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the UK, and on the one hand you have the proponents of GM saying that in that set of technologies lie all sorts of answers to really critical problems that we face today including of\~course increased yields.  That's the big promise increased yields, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3852}{\*\bkmkend ldl3852}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we on\~the other hand would be arguing yes all sorts of problems about that, impacts on\~the environment, possible impacts on human health all to I never thought that was a really particularly a big deal, therefore we need\~to\~exercise a much clearer proportionary principle before }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3901}{\*\bkmkend ldl3901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we start rolling out yet more GM strains all round the world.  \line \tab       If you look back on that debate, historically you will find that hardly ever did we use that debate to invite people to go right back to a different kind of analysis, about }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3951}{\*\bkmkend ldl3951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}food production, a different kind of analysis about the relationship between human kind and the earth and the natural systems on which we depend, to re-examine the relationships, the reciprocity between us under the earth.  We had a technical debate whether GM did or }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4001}{\*\bkmkend ldl4001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}did not constitute a threat, would or would\~not produce additional yields.  Very rarely did that debate allow us\~to go right back into the heartland of what the permaculture movement has always been about which is a different set of design principles.  To underpin the way in }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4051}{\*\bkmkend ldl4051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}which human beings produce the food that they need for the future.  \line \tab       So we became if you like, victims of this set of locked in mind sets.  We had\~to play on their territory, on their turf we can't really start exercising our opportunity }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4101}{\*\bkmkend ldl4101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to talk about this stuff very differently.  So for\~me it's brilliant that conferences like this now, are reminding people of the need to co-deeper, to dig down into what these principles really terrible us.  \line \tab       I\~was fascinated just reading some of the materials }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4151}{\*\bkmkend ldl4151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that are becoming available to all of us, it's extraordinary if you think over the history of\~the permaculture movement the wealth, the sheer abundance of resources available to us now, the opportunities to connect instantly with brilliant examples of permaculture projects all round the world }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4201}{\*\bkmkend ldl4201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is staggering.  I hope some of you after connected web based initiative called food tank I have been part of right from it's inception, based in the States, recently back in July did this brilliant analysis about what going on in\~the world of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4251}{\*\bkmkend ldl4251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}permaculture.  Came up with this lovely summary that more tan a million people have now been certified in one form of permaculture qualification or another in more than 140 round the world with more than 4,000 individual projects a life and well somewhere on that wonderful map }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4301}{\*\bkmkend ldl4301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we saw before.  \line \tab       This a\~lot of activity \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}.  In the run up\~to this conference I\~was able\~to\~do a tiny bit of work with Phil Loren working with your wonderful magazine, bringing together a series of people and projects to produce 6, 9 actually little }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4351}{\*\bkmkend ldl4351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}films called Living With The Land I do strongly urge you to have a look at that series I am sure it will get\~a lot of plugging during that conference it's a really brilliant little set of 9 background films in terms of what happening with }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4401}{\*\bkmkend ldl4401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}permaculture, I\~think they are all based here in the UK, but as an example of what happens everywhere else.  \line \tab       Now for\~me as I look at all of that I see in it not just the value of each of those individual projects but I }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4451}{\*\bkmkend ldl4451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}see this bigger story that Tim was hinting at, the sense that there\~is something going on under the surface, almost as a subversive movement in our society, where we're not just growing food in more intelligent and sensible ways, we're not just allowing organic matter to crow }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4501}{\*\bkmkend ldl4501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in the soil, but we are growing adaptive capabilities in our own mind.  We're allowing people to free themselves from the dominance of those industrial mind sets.  \line \tab       This is both an intellectual and spiritual.  I am sure we all welcome the research network which }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4551}{\*\bkmkend ldl4551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the was launched today, many people like\~to dig down for spiritual insights as well as intellectual.  When I read the book when you very kindly referred to I should have been flogging my book here today, so should you Tim we have got to get better }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4601}{\*\bkmkend ldl4601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}at this green capitalism stuff, it\~was the most amazing period of my life it cave me an opportunity to do research into reasons to be hopeful, reasons to stop my own deep apocalyptic tendencies to nip them in\~the bud ever time I find myself heading off one }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4651}{\*\bkmkend ldl4651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of\~the deeply gloomy rabbit holes that\~I spend so much of my life in and bring it back to the sense of genuine hopefulness round what is that people are doing today.  Because this story that the permaculture movement has been such an important part of for decades is }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4701}{\*\bkmkend ldl4701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}not just doable, it is being done.  It's not a theoretical possibility that might at some stage come about at some point in\~the future when all else has demonstrably failed it's a story unfolding in the midst of people's lives right now.  Being able to get }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4751}{\*\bkmkend ldl4751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to grips with some of that stuff to research the story of agroforestry in Africa for\~instance, which is an incredible story emerging in are midst to understood the power of agronomic techniques things like mixed cropping, to look\~at the explosive story about urban farming all round the world, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4802}{\*\bkmkend ldl4802}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}not all of it based on permaculture design principles but lot of it thinking more deeply.  This was wonderful, it's just an eye opening journey, through literally hundreds of objects and examples of people making this solution this alternative emerge in the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4851}{\*\bkmkend ldl4851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}midst of our lives.  Now some of that stuff will probably be quite challenging, to those of us who think that all good food should really come from a beautiful relationship between ourselves and the land because actually that is not the future of all food production.   Food }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4902}{\*\bkmkend ldl4902}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}production in 2015 looks very different from the way it looks today, that because the only way to reduce the pressure on the limited amount of land we have available, to produce good, nutritious food on a genuinely sustainable basis without massive cruelty to animals, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4953}{\*\bkmkend ldl4953}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the way, way to do that is\~to start using science for some different kinds of food production.  I am not going to go into this in any great\~deal, because I know how difficult it is but artificial meat in 2050, meat grown in laboratories }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5002}{\*\bkmkend ldl5002}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in factories, in systems that where there's no connection with the natural world the earth at all, will\~be a major part of our protein intake in 2050.  Most people, yuck, we don't really want to go down that road.  Don't you?  I\~think }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5051}{\*\bkmkend ldl5051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}you really do want to go down that road.  When you think about it from an animal welfare perspective, from a land perspective, from an input and climate perspective I tell you that whole area of research and development that is going on now and is exploding }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5101}{\*\bkmkend ldl5101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}whether you like it or\~not, is fascinating.  How\~much of our protein do you think will come from algae, the phenomenal role they have played in some of revolutionary moments in earth, I\~think they are about to start playing another astonishingly important }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5151}{\*\bkmkend ldl5151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}part in food production.  I\~was recently in Brazil, visited a new plant just been in production for a year, owned by a large American company in association with another even larger American company called bungi, which is producing oils, algae oils using }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5201}{\*\bkmkend ldl5201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}genetically modified micro algae, using a product that is at the moment sourced by companies from palm oil.  There's a big controversy about palm oil, it's a crop that has destroyed an awful lot of rainforest.  What this company is doing }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5251}{\*\bkmkend ldl5251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}it's slightly like alchemy.  They take roughly 2 milligrams of microalgae, some of which are not GM, they then feed those little critters as they call them, they feed the little }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5301}{\*\bkmkend ldl5301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}critters\~with sugar that is sourced from a wonderfully certified sugar production, in these great big fermentation tanks.  They grow rapidly because they can't believe they\~are being looked after so attentively, so much love }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5351}{\*\bkmkend ldl5351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and care, and within the course of just a few days, they grow from their 2 millilitres to roughly 150,000 litres then they stop feeding them which is really cruel of\~course, but at that point the micro algae, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5403}{\*\bkmkend ldl5403}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}go into adaptive cervical behaviour, start producing these oils, ward off the moment of their eventual demise, from there they go from roughly 250 litres to 600,000 litres, most of which is the kind of oil we need to put into soap, detergent and everything else, crush it, dry it, }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}squeeze}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} it out, you get 100m tonnes of oil, exactly the same oil that we get from palm kernal oil, are we going to like that stuff, or are we going to say, "We don't like that", it is difficult we will get these dilemmas coming all the time, is industrial }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}biology}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} feeds into synthetic biology, some of them will be absolutely brilliant in terms of enabling us to use the land more intelligently, more compassionately than we are currently able to do, God knows we might even find a way of restoring some of that land to purposes that don't necessarily feed us, i.e. some of the natural eco-system services that }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:8001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}we depend on that we have currently spent as\~much time destroying.  In conclusion it's a really, really exciting world.  For me looking around the scene of creative chaos that is out there, this scene of excitement, about new possibilities, the doability of what lies ahead, I think it is an extraordinary moment for us to recognise the role that we play in movements like this. \line \tab       One last thought, when I was doing my research for the world we made and looking at many of these projects on the ground projects, they split into two for me, I call them enclaves and out posts, I think this is relevant to the world of Permaculture.  Enclaves were kind of refuges, a sense of people wanting to withdraw from the horror of our industrial farming systems indicative that the start for our conference here was to pause and think about the damage we have done to the natural world.  Late of people over the last few decades have withdrawn from the sense of horror into the refuges, into these enclaves where we can indeed }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}dream}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} of a different world and we can think about the principles that would allow us to move forward in a different way.  A very important part of the Permaculture world is developing that set of insights that kind of perennial wisdom to shape our minds and our spirits.  Very differently, closely connected but very differently, one discovers all these out posts, people who want to put themselves on a frontline somewhere, do not want to withdraw into a refuge, want to engage in a place of difficulty, sometimes even of danger, want to involve themselves in the lives of people very directly who are not really worried about the niceties of theory about food security, but are grappling with the daily horror of food in security.  This is something that I think we all need to pay more attention to.  These out posts are basically made of people who are out there joining their efforts, joining their passion to those of the communities in which they're working, to address social justice concerns as much as to address a different way of thinking about food production differently.  Somewhere in that balancing act between refuges and out posts, between proper reflection and dreaming and action-orientated social justice commitment to a better world for people right now, wrangling a better world as well as dreaming it, somewhere that's a the balancing act we need to find.  I'm pretty sure the next couple of days will provide a huge amount of opportunity to think where we sit in that continuum and celebrate the incredible diversity that underpins it.

It could take ten minutes to get out of here - \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} - it could take you ten minutes to get to your next session and there is only 30 minutes.  So probably go and get a drink, I suggest you go towards your session room and have your conversation when you are near there.

I don't think it's going to be that fill and it's difficulty for us speakers to throw themselves and to be able to see you.  So please come down.  Anyone who is up in the Gods, and wants to be this session, come down.  Ok good morning, my name is Declan Kennedy, I'm pretty well, most likely the oldest permaculturist in the room, because I was responsible for bringing Mollison into Europe in 1981 and immediately afterwards did my designer course in Tasmania.  So that's enough from me.  So we're into a really terrific topic here, creative change.  We're trying to put it on different levels and to talk about what's really happening.

Thank you and off you go. \line MUMTA ITO:  So, hi everyone, just to give a brief introduction about myself before we go into the topic.  My name is Mumta Ito, the founder of an organisation called Rights of Nature, Europe, which is about establishing Rights of Nature in law.  My career background is in law, I'm a lawyer with both corporate and grass-roots experience and so, everything that I talk about in this talk really comes from deep experience of how the system works. \line \tab       So, who here feels that we are nature, part of the interdependent web of }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:9001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}life?  If you feel that raise your hand.  Ok, that's pretty much everybody here.  So who here understands why having that in law is such a game changer?  Ok.  Not so many hands.  So, in this talk I'm going to explain how our current structure of law exacerbates the problem, how it legitimises the destruction of nature and how it prevents order people like you and I from taking action on environmental issues, using the law. \line \tab       I'm also going to explain how Rights of Nature is such a game changer and say a little bit about how people, ordinary people like you and I are taking action to bring in a new structure of law, to create the kind of world that we want to create for ourselves and also for future generations. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sb100\sa100\s31\sl360\slmult1\itap0{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch \tab       So the first thing about law is that our legal system is based on outdated paradigms, this morning we heard a lot about the outdated paradigms in agriculture and food systems, well it's the same in law.  Are law is based on a paradigm that is mechanistic, treats things in isolation from each other and anthropocentric, it regards the world as only consisting of human beings and nothing else.  It's retributive it pits one party against the other, rather than co-creating solutions that get to the root of the problem. \line \tab       Science has long seen a fluid and interconnected world but our systems really need to catch-up, this is specially the case with the law. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sb100\sa100\s31\sl360\slmult1\itap0{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch \tab       In our modern world law facilitates economics and the problem is that it's facilitating an economic paradigm, a model of growth that is coupled with the destruction of nature, the logical conclusion is that we end up killing everything.  This economic paradigm has one key concept that under lies it, that's the utility value of nature, valuing nature solely for it's usefulness for human beings as a resource for human consumption.  Now this translates in law as nature being an 'Object', under the law, separate to us.  It's either property or it's fair game.  This has a number of practical draw backs that make it virtually impossible for ordinary people like you and I to protect nature using the law.  The first of this is that we end up with a piecemeal protection system.  So nature is an object.  The law governs relationships but it only governs relationships between subjects of the law and at the moment the only subjects are human beings and corporations.  . \line \tab       If there is no relationship then there is no duty of care.  Now, the duty of care is a whole body of law that deals with obligations, because there is }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:9501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}no relationship, no duty of care can exist because there is no person to owe this duty of care towards.  So there are no obligations towards nature, including no obligations to restore nature or to make good any damage caused to nature. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sb100\sa100\s31\sl360\slmult1\itap0{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch \tab       So we start out with a premise that nature is unprotected and environmental law comes into carve out protections, it does this usually around endangered species, protection for endangered species and their habitats.  However that system is piece-meal, in an interconnected eco-system who is to say which species is a VIP.  Also these laws are fundamentally flawed because they cannot keep pace with current extinction rates, all of these species that are about to go extinct are listed in an annex at the back of the law.  It takes years of difficulty research to update the annex.  Scientist say we are losing something like 12 species a day.  In the time it takes to update the annex, it's already too late. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sb100\sa100\s31\sl360\slmult1\itap0{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch \tab       Another drawback of nature being property under the law, is that we are stuck in the planning system.  All environmental issues are deemed to be planning issues and the only conversation that can happen in court is whether the correct planning procedure was followed.  So communities have to find technical arguments and that's assuming that they even have standing to bring a case.  Even if a technical argument to say that the planners haven't ticked the right boxes was found, the very highest at come that can come out of the planning tribunal is that it goes back to the planners for them to tick the box.  Usually it goes round the cycle and development, eventually, goes ahead and communities run out of steam. \line \tab       The other issue is standing.  In the planning system only people who's property rights have been affected have standing to bring a case.  So, for example, me living in the Highlands of Scotland if I'm worried about mining going on in a protected area I don't have standing to do anything about it, my individual property rights are not affected. \line \tab       There is also presumption that all development is beneficial.  Economic interests trump everything else.  So, this mining in the national park which was recently approved in the UK, the largest mine inside a national park was done on economic grounds even though there are 29 environmental organisations opposing it, with grave concerns about the eco-system, the law was on the side of the planners and so it got approved. \line \tab       The only other avenue left in law is litigation, so after a disaster happens, say for\~example 10 years down the line we find that mining }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5451}{\*\bkmkend ldl5451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}inside the national park was not a great idea for the ecosystem, so then if somebody wants to bring a case they have got to be a property owner inside the national park, who's property has been damaged.  Then they can bring a case for their }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5501}{\*\bkmkend ldl5501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}own monetary loss.  There's no obligation to restore the damage to nature because nature is an object under the law and there's no relationship.  \line \tab       So other avenues that have emerged recently, which strengthen the reductionist approach and this nature is property paradigm and biodiversity }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5551}{\*\bkmkend ldl5551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}off setting, and so our governments are now proposing we should speed up the planning process, so environmental assessment are not required if we can have no net loss of ecosystems.  So if I want to do fracking or something like that, I can't }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5601}{\*\bkmkend ldl5601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}put in my application and say I will destroy this ecosystem here and I will restore another one somewhere else, and because there's no net loss it's all ok.  Well you and I both know that ecosystems don't work in that way.  Everything is radically interconnected. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5652}{\*\bkmkend ldl5652}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}We also end up with a governance system where environmental issues are only dealt with at the micro level, an individual planning cases, with no requirement to look at the cumulative affect of all of these decisions together.  \line \tab       So how is all this }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5701}{\*\bkmkend ldl5701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}relevant to permaculture you may ask.  Well, if I have got my permaculture farm going and I am doing a great job, but I have got a corporation that's decided to do fracking next door, it's the same ecosystem.  So we end up collectively }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5751}{\*\bkmkend ldl5751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}going nowhere if the law is favouring the destruction.  This is why we need fundamental and we need systemic change.  This is what rights of nature brings.  \line \tab       So with rights of nature, we're going from utility value to intrinsic value, we're valuing }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5801}{\*\bkmkend ldl5801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}nature in and of itself.  We do that by making nature a subject of the law, like us, like corporations, and we bring nature into the system.  If nature is a subject of the law, then it can be the holder of rights. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5851}{\*\bkmkend ldl5851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Rights which are enforceable in court, by communities like you and I.  \line \tab       With rights of nature, it's not just the ecosystems themselves that now have standing, but also people are empowered to defend the rights of those ecosystems in\~a court of law.  So }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5902}{\*\bkmkend ldl5902}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}if I am up in the Highlands I am worried about the mining that's going on in England, in the national park, I can now bring a case, I can stand for nature by naming nature as the one that is sustaining the damage and injury. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5951}{\*\bkmkend ldl5951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}I don't have to prove that my property rights have been disturbed in anyway, because there\~is now an injured party in that ecosystem itself.  \line \tab       So, in making nature a subject of the law, we're also creating this relationship and we're creating the duty }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6001}{\*\bkmkend ldl6001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of care.  The body of law that brings in obligations and this includes the obligation to restore.  The obligation to make good the damage that we have done to nature.  So\~any cases if I were to bring a case of some damage that the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6051}{\*\bkmkend ldl6051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}national park has sustained, any remedy won't go to me personally, it will go to the national park.  To the restoration of the national park itself because it is a subject of the law.  \line \tab       Having nature as a subject of the law, also paves }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6101}{\*\bkmkend ldl6101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the way for ecological governance, a system that understand that ecosystems are interconnected living systems.  The highest protection that the law gives is in the form of rights.  The final thing that rights of nature does is that it reverses the psychology of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6151}{\*\bkmkend ldl6151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}separation from nature which I feel is really at the root of the crisis that we have today.  \line \tab       So how are people taking action to bring about this change?  Well, expansion in rights has always come from the people.  So people in Ecuador campaigned for }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6201}{\*\bkmkend ldl6201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}this approach, they got into conversation with the Government, and Ecuador become the first country to have the rights of nature enshrined in law, in it's constitution.  It put it in is constitution but it didn't translate it into law.  In Bolivia, they took }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6251}{\*\bkmkend ldl6251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that step and they had it in law together with a framework that also deals with transitioning into an economic paradigm that operates in harmony with nature.  We see judges, we see lawyers in the court system recognising the rights of nature in their court judgements, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6302}{\*\bkmkend ldl6302}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in Ecuador and Belize and Costa Rica, Argentina, even New Zealand.  Within the UN there\~are people switching on to these ideas there\~is a harmony with nature department who's agenda is really to raise awareness within that body adopting a declaration for the rights or nature. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6351}{\*\bkmkend ldl6351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\line \tab       I am really interested in the local level.  In the United\~States, in over 36 municipalities, ordinary people like you\~and I have got into strong conversation with their local leavers, they have brought in legal recognition of the rights of nature at the local }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6401}{\*\bkmkend ldl6401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}level.  This includes cities like Santa Monica and Pittsburgh and the same happened in Mexico city, ordinary people like you and me campaigning brought about changes in the law so Mexico city also has rights of later enshrined in law at local lever.  \line \tab       I\uc1\u8217\'92m }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6451}{\*\bkmkend ldl6451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}holding here the Santa Monica law it's really worth a read because it's really quite inspiring.  The title is An Ordinance Of the City Council of Santa Monica establishing sustainability rights.  They start off explaining is similar to what I have explained in that }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6501}{\*\bkmkend ldl6501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}despite having all these laws, destruction still continues, having assessed the reason why we think nature is a big contributor to this forward thinking progressing countries round the world like Ecuador, Bolivia, taking all that into account we're now passing this local law. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6551}{\*\bkmkend ldl6551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}In the law section they couple rights of nature with the right to a healthy environment, recognising that it's not possible for us human beings to have a right to a healthy environment, if the ecosystems that are actually creating the healthy environment don't have }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6601}{\*\bkmkend ldl6601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a corresponding right to their own integral health.  \line \tab       So here we have got rights of people to clean water from sustainable sources, to clear air, to sustainable food systems, local healthy food, sustainable climate, all of that.  Then we have }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6651}{\*\bkmkend ldl6651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the rights of natural communities and ecosystems to exist and to flourish.  Then we're also in this, giving rights to the residents of the city to be able to protect the rights of nature, by bringing cases so it's actually acts to give them standing in courts which }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6701}{\*\bkmkend ldl6701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}people don't have at the moment.  Then the final limb is\~the subordination of corporate powers whether\~or\~not corporations are acting against the common good.  This one I really quite inspiring it says "all\~the resident Santa Monica possess the right to self governance and to a municipal Government }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6751}{\*\bkmkend ldl6751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}which recognise that all power is inherent in the people, all free Governments are founded on the people's authority and consent that corporate entities and their directors and managers do not enjoy special privileges or powers understanding the law that subordinate the community's rights to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6801}{\*\bkmkend ldl6801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}their private interests" that really tackling it at the core.  I find this law very inspiring it's a live example of something that done into local city that was brought in by people and it's embedded in the planning policy.  It\~wasn't done in response to a threat, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6852}{\*\bkmkend ldl6852}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}it\~was done out of the desire to create the world that we all want\~to create.  \line \tab       We can do the same in Europe.  So in Europe we're bringing European citizens\uc1\u8217\'92 initiative we have participatory democracy here in Europe so citizens can propose laws.  1 million signatures }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6901}{\*\bkmkend ldl6901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}across 7 EU states with a minimum level of 0.01% of the population of those states can put the rights of nature on the legislative agenda of the European Union.  We have decided organising this.  The citizens\uc1\u8217\'92 initiative needs people, it needs citizens to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6951}{\*\bkmkend ldl6951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}take action.  That means you and all your friends.  \line \tab       We drafted a directive, a directive is a very efficient way of bringing change in the EU, because if the EU adopts the directive it immediately becomes law in all of the Member\~States. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7001}{\*\bkmkend ldl7001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}In our directive, we advocate the collective rights of ecosystems and species to exist, thrive, renew their vital cycles.  We give legal personality, deal with the duty of care, the human right to the healthy environment present and future generations, restore }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7051}{\*\bkmkend ldl7051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}justice, problem solving courts, ecological governance, and so forth.  That not the end of it there\~are also national initiatives and local initiatives.  \line \tab       In Europe about 18 countries have national initiatives where citizens can propose laws and bring to\~it referendum.  At the local level, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7102}{\*\bkmkend ldl7102}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}several countries in Europe also have that.   In the UK if there's anybody here from\~the UK, did you know in the UK in\~a parish council residents can bring any matter to referendum, it only takes 5 people plus 10 people present at the meeting, to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7151}{\*\bkmkend ldl7151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}actually propose the referendum.  Now is that not doable?  \line \tab       So really, what I am asking you for is a call to action.  Rights cannot be expanded without people coming forward and without expanding our consciousness as well.  With every expansion of rights, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7201}{\*\bkmkend ldl7201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}there came an expansion in consciousness.  Are we ready to take it to the next level?  So\~I am inviting you\~to join us to get in touch with us, if you feel inspired and you would like\~to shift the paradigm of law, you don't know how to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7251}{\*\bkmkend ldl7251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}draft a law, get in touch with us.

The way we have defined it in our }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7401}{\*\bkmkend ldl7401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}draft directive is that including but not limited to ecosystems species, the atmospheric climate.  However we have also put in there, that the European environmental agency would come up with a universal definition for what an ecosystem is that can be applied consistently, throughout }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7451}{\*\bkmkend ldl7451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}all the States, but when we look at rights of nature laws people are defining the ecosystems or the areas of nature that are protected according to what's there in the locality, particularly in the local laws, but one of the general threads is that the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7501}{\*\bkmkend ldl7501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}focus is on the balance it's mainly ecosystems and species that are the target of this law.  \line DECLAN KENNEDY: Any further questions?  \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab  Thank you for a very clear inspiring talk, one thing that did occur to me was that it's not, it's in\~the nature of natural }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7551}{\*\bkmkend ldl7551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}systems that it's not necessarily possible to make good damage done to them.  So what would you say about that?  \line MUMTA ITO: In the case that the damage is irreparable, within the law there\~are other ways of dealing with the person that they have done something, and }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7601}{\*\bkmkend ldl7601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}it may not be possible to restore that ecosystem, but that they ought to do something for nature, somewhere.  Yeah I agree, any nature can put itself back and us as human beings can do what we can to help that process along, but in }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7651}{\*\bkmkend ldl7651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}some cases where that is not possible, we still need\~to\~deal with the people who have actually done the damage, and kind of get them to behave in ways that can actually enhance nature, albeit somewhere else.  \line DECLAN KENNEDY: I\~think this will be the last one.  }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

I have been involved in setting up an organisation called Safe Alliance which is looking at legal tools to counter fracking, we have got the current challenge to raise money to make the Government to court.  Through that work }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7751}{\*\bkmkend ldl7751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}one of\~the things I have seen there\~is no meaningful legal basis for sustainable development, so it's not only has it become a completely meaningless term it's becoming a legal way through policy and the evolution of law to actually mean just continued economic development.  I wondered if you could }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7801}{\*\bkmkend ldl7801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}comment on whether there would be any point in pursuing establishing a proper legal basis to sustainable development which would include the rights of nature a along with the precautionary principle and other key elements.  }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

That's a really key thing that you have pointed out.  With nature being an object under the law, what we have, umm... what we have is a system where we are always reactively legislating to carve out the protections, we can't do it fast enough at the moment.  With Rights of Nature we are advocating that we proactively create what you are talking about, actually create a framework for sustainability, like you rightly point out there isn't one at the moment.  So yeah, I'm 100% with you.  That's what we are trying to establish with our Rights of Nature, it's not just about rights, it involves ecological governance, it involves so many other aspects the human right\~to the healthy environment, you know, there are some future generations, they are all interlinked, they all form a comprehensive framework.  So, yeah, I would be very interested to connect with you on this. \line DECLAN KENNEDY:  Ok we have to thank you.  I think it's a really good plea to get it going, as a permaculture action, Permaculture is action, it's an important part of it, so thank you very much indeed.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line MUMTA ITO:  Thank you. \line DECLAN KENNEDY:  Thank you.  Do you want to stay down there or come up, the next person is Lachlan Mackenzie, he's taking a view on change from the other part of the world, you could say.  Way down south in Australia.  Mainly based on intergenerational change.  I would like to introduce yourself and you can take this microphone or speak at that one as\~you wish.  It's very good to have your microphone.  We are streaming.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}talk to AV person}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line LACHLAN MACKENZIE:  We have given a PowerPoint that should be loaded up already.  Whilst that's happening, that was a great talk, that last one, that was really inspirational.  We are going to take a very different look about creating change.  We're actually going to use the example from developing countries, so as an introduction, my name is Lachlan Mackenzie, I've been working in east Timor for five years and Indonesia for one year, doing permaculture, working with local groups and I've been really lucky to see how permaculture can really influence and create long lasting change within the aid industry and that's what we are going to talk about today, because a lot of people see that industry as not being that - quite wasteful and often a representation of our way of life in western countries at the moment, but, yeah, I've just been amazed to see how permaculture can actually work with that and create the really long lasting, ground-up generation change that we see in different countries.  I\~have a dear friend, Gisele, up }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:10501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}here to help and present her respective as well. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sb100\sa100\s31\sl360\slmult1\itap0{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch GISELE:  So, just to got us started, what we think are some of the added value that permaculture can bring to development work, is that it's holistic and integrated.  That it's design-orientated, so you are creating that vision and from the very beginning you are outlining the change you want to see, you are doing that in an integrated way and not in a silo way, what we have a lot in the aid industry, we have a development project focusing on food industry, on health, what permaculture does is actually integrate different things and because it is design-orientated, it's very much about thinking those processes through and those relationships and maximising them.  It's able to hold a vision for food sovereignty, it's obviously about people taking control of the food systems and, you know, from beginning to end and permacultural allows for that as well.  It's also has a role in the cycle of relief, so from response to rehabilitation, to development and you can actually integrate permaculture through all those different stages and we're going to share with you some examples of Ache where we both worked where we saw that happening and, yeah and it also is supportive of building resilience and sustainability. \line LACHLAN MACKENZIE:  I just wanted to, that last point, back to roots, ancestor knowledge.  I wanted to highlight that, I was interviewing staff in east Timor, I was asking them, what does it mean to you, what does permacultural bring out?  Three of the staff, immediately the first thing they said was, "It helps us to strengthen our knowledge and our culture.  Our culture is being fractured."  It's the best mechanism they can see to help to imbed their culture and their traditional knowledge in moving forward and I found that really powerful and it was amazing that was just like the number one response from three of them. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sb100\sa100\s31\sl360\slmult1\itap0{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch GISELE:  I think also because it up holds traditional knowledge, I think people in Timor felt that resonate very closely to them.  So maybe we just... yep.  So about Ache so we both had the privilege of }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:11001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}working there with different points of view, I went in with a big international NGO to do relief work, the first thing I saw was a lot of waste, too much money donated for sue Naomi relief more than the organisations could absorb, people were fighting for beneficiaries literally, you know the money is ear-marked for that stuff and you have to build 'x' amount of houses, everybody else wants to build houses, in the end you had people with two or three houses that were built, there was a huge fight for that, what do we do, here we have all that money, it's not actually helpful, it's creating a lot of conflict on the ground within the communities themselves and this is where development can really go wrong and can be quite wasteful.  What I remembered, in that situation I remembered, Eric Colts, did a study of Hurricane }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Mitch}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} in the communities that were practising agro ecology, how they were more resilient and were able to bounce-back from Hurricane Mitch than communities that weren't.  I thought what can I too with this money that will be meaningful and transformative for these people's lives not just bringing them back to where they were before the tsunami, but transforming their potential and capacity to interact with their eco-systems and their environments.  I founded the green hands permaculture field school and Declan worked directly with them, he'll tell you more about it. \line LACHLAN MACKENZIE:  I was invited to come out there by Edip Foundation, if you go to Indonesia look them up, they too pretty amazing disaster recovery work and permaculture culture work.  Oh look, there is Gisele up there!  I came from it from the perspective that I got to see them in action going out to help actually give skills and give hope and give practical help to really make people feel like they were able to move on.  One of the most amazing examples was a whole group of fisherman, all their families had been moved up to in the mountain in they had no idea about fishing, the first thing we wanted to do was create fish ponds, combine waste systems, moved all that, made fish ponds, used water plants to create compost for their veg gardens, all of this not just giving them income, but giving them things to do and giving them a bit more structure and giving them a sense of community and connection.  These guys were, like, in demand all over Aceh, it was quite amazing to see.  . }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sb100\sa100\s31\sl360\slmult1\itap0{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch GISELE:  Back to the aid industry, we really see a potential that can be harnessed here.  I guess the thing that I want to highlight here, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:11502"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is that it's not just about funding, but you can use that money and you can harness that to fund good products like the green hands field school, but it can also }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}be}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} a conduit for change.  We talked very much about evidence-based solutions and like, demonstrating what actually works and the best practices and sharing best practices, that's all language that's quite used in\~the aid industry what I've tried to do by integrating permaculture into that aid work officially is the recognition that these solutions too work for communities, because they actually are grounded in people's realities and they empower people to create their destiny and to be architects of the lives that they want to live.  I think you wanted to say something. \line LACHLAN MACKENZIE:  Umm... I would just add that it's been really encouraging in my last trip to Timor in June and July, just to see how, even the big organisations are now realising that this big scale movement and trying to get the developing countries to be like us, is not actually the way we need to do it, we need to get the developing countries to be like themselves.  Also, in terms of sustainability, it has to be small scale farm holding, intensive, organically based and with a view to understanding the bigger picture and, luckily, we are involved in something called permaculture, which kind of tends to cover that all pretty well. \line \tab       Here's a little example of international NGO in Timor.  The guy who created this programme went over as a conventional agriculturist and came as a hippy permaculturist, he helped a lot with some of the stuff we were doing and one of the projects was this ground pump technology, very, very simple, perfect for the places where they were put in and, yeah, very low kind of maintenance, low umm... like, you know, no generators or anything.  It worked.  So, so that's the kind of thing that we can see happen, you know, on a big scale.  We can't just say, like you know, they are all bad or this is all could or what ever, it's a matter of trying to get the best out of everyone and also understanding that there is amazing people out there doing work in all the different NGOs in the UN and the FAO and the local NGOs, it's getting the best out of that and getting information connected between everyone. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sb100\sa100\s31\sl360\slmult1\itap0{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch GISELE:  Yeah, also just to say that permaculture is transformative for the communities we work with and the workers as well, let's not forget that we go to other places and take that experience with us.  So, you know, combined we have something like 30 }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:12001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}years of experience in this sector and in this time, what we have seen are different models of how you can actually integrate permaculture into mainstream development.  This is not meant to be exhaustive, it's something we saw as different models.  One is to have local organisations as movement builders.  Here we have the case of Permatil }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7851}{\*\bkmkend ldl7851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}which unfortunately you are\~missing because ego is talking about them upstairs right now it's a Timor organisation envisaging long-term accompaniment to communities and who are doing really good strong advocacy work on the ground also with the Ministry of Agriculture in Timor to influence them to support smallholder }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7901}{\*\bkmkend ldl7901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}producers in\~a sustainable way.  That is\~the local organisation a movement builder and again the importance of movement builders.  This is because after the aid industry goes who stays are the local NGO and the local civil society, so we need to remember that.  \line \tab  }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7951}{\*\bkmkend ldl7951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}    Also local organisations as service providers, so we have already spoken about the case of the green hands field school in Aceh, where there\~was a training centre, they were creating they were being contracted and subcontracted to do development work and support that. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8001}{\*\bkmkend ldl8001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Then you have another model which Lachlan will talk about next which I embedded solidarity, this was another organisation that we came across in are work in East\~Timor an organisation called Na Terra, Portuguese in solidarity the they were embedded in the community, they were reading supporting }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8051}{\*\bkmkend ldl8051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}object projects for the community, they were creaking links between what's happening globally and what's happening locally in Timor that really important for movement building also.  \line \tab       Then finally mentoring, which is something that everybody can do, you if you are willing\~to spend }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8101}{\*\bkmkend ldl8101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}time and I do meantime, because these things don't happen overnight, but if you are willing\~to spend time with the community, and to provide them with some of the skills that you\~have, and share that with them, you can really go a long way.  I\~think Lachlan }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8151}{\*\bkmkend ldl8151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is\~the case in point here of how he did that.  You can support people, it's not just about financial support, we really need to move beyond that in I\~think development work in general.  \line LACHLAN MCKENZIE: Hopefully to get through all of\~the slides we could talk about this }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8201}{\*\bkmkend ldl8201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}for days.  Both very seen a\~lot of stuff and amazing things, but yeah just very, very quickly so Na Terra's nursery they have created a 2 acre model system within\~the community, they have taken a few years to do it got the neighbours }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8251}{\*\bkmkend ldl8251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and community on board they are growing fruit trees that crow well in the area and giving them at.  It's the slow filtering out process rather than big scale the community are coming along with it, that's what needs\~to happen to create that generational change.  \line \tab       Did }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8302}{\*\bkmkend ldl8302}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}you want to do the partnerships?  \line GISELE HENRIQUES: Really quickly partnerships are key I am not going to dwell on that but they are really important for connecting people and for building movements you have the slide up there.  I\~don't\~know if you want to talk about ok}{\*\bkmkstart ldl8351}{\*\bkmkend ldl8351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}. \line LACHLAN MCKENZIE: These terraces were done in one morning, this was partnership with a local NGO, it\~was all about getting people to realise how to move from one type of agriculture which was not sustainable in the long run, but including their cultural knowledge and }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8401}{\*\bkmkend ldl8401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}then creating something which was more intensive and productive and these terraces, this was one of\~the first examples, now if you go there you will see them all offer the mountain side because people saw they worked and then they duplicated it.  \line GISELE HENRIQUES: Just a really quick thing }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8452}{\*\bkmkend ldl8452}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}if partnerships are key then community is a pre-condition for success, and so it is really critical that the community be involved in all the stages from setting the vision to designing to implementing and learning and throughout.  Again, just the idea of accompaniment }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8502}{\*\bkmkend ldl8502}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is really critical you can't just launch these things turn round and go\~away, it needs slow percolation, hence the importance of local partnerships to keep these things going.  \line LACHLAN MCKENZIE: Just one more point I want to expand on, everything is available to everyone.  Permatil's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8553}{\*\bkmkend ldl8553}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}one of the main goals from\~the very beginning they wanted to give examples to show techniques, to create designs that anyone from the poorest to the most remote, to the richest to the urban to villages, everyone could do it could duplicate it.  That's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8601}{\*\bkmkend ldl8601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}been the base of\~the model.  That's over the long-term given them a huge amount of respect it's created that success that the community know that they are not just being given something which is high and pie in the sky, they can actually use it and everyone they }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8651}{\*\bkmkend ldl8651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}can.  This is one of up in the mountains the community said one of the things which is most important to us, and also for protect their environment is to actually reduce the amount of wood, so the clay stove workshops which Elsa is demonstrating how }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8701}{\*\bkmkend ldl8701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to make, have been very successful and that came out of the community consultation process of what was actually needed.  \line GISELE HENRIQUES: Just one point I want to say in this slide because of\~the interests of time I mean funding is critical you need it in\~order to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8751}{\*\bkmkend ldl8751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}actually get the stuff done, but you need to be creative about it, it's not just getting funding from Governments or INGO things like that in Indonesia they do which everyone in Europe has done for centuries, which is community coming together to work on each other's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8802}{\*\bkmkend ldl8802}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}plot at different times if you harness some of that you can go along way.  We know people and we are ourselves have been involved in things where no money was involved we were able\~to\~do a make zing significant things just eye harnessing the community potential.  \line LACHLAN MCKENZIE: }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8851}{\*\bkmkend ldl8851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}This is not any a way to clean water, it being a way for EDIP foundation to make money, so they can do this for communities and help to show how you can clean your waste water and reuse it, but there\~are also sub contracting out to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8901}{\*\bkmkend ldl8901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}hotels, restaurants, to offices, and actually building these, getting paid for it which then generates more income, that goes into the development work.

So kind of really working through empowerment and I\~think permaculture is a really strong way of doing that of making }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9101}{\*\bkmkend ldl9101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}people feel like they can be architects of their own destiny.  It's important to embed this into other process, whether it's advocacy or influencing processes locally or the curriculum, we have done that in East Timor I\~don't\~know if you want to talk about that. }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9151}{\*\bkmkend ldl9151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\line DECLAN KENNEDY: You have just got a minute then we go\~into discussion.  \line LACHLAN MCKENZIE: We'll go very quickly through the last couple.  So we created a guide book in East\~Timor as a response too need and it\~was created with that same idea that anyone could access the information, there's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9201}{\*\bkmkend ldl9201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a huge amount of pictures it's all about giving people without much language the ability to understand it.

Also }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9302}{\*\bkmkend ldl9302}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}understanding what is success and for whom.

There\~is such a process, there\~is a\~lot of bad parts going on to it, but we have been able to see so much ground up action and the good thing about permaculture is that it fits into, you look at any particular }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9551}{\*\bkmkend ldl9551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}part of aid industry whether it be health, livelihoods, sustainable development, whether it be the whole range and agriculture and permaculture fits into it all, it actually makes those connections.  When you are talking to NGOs and they, there's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9601}{\*\bkmkend ldl9601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}something that clicks.  It's like a library bulb moment when they go oh wow that exactly like, that covers all\~the facets.  So maybe, we're not creating a huge change overall but we have seen a big step and it's not just us in permaculture, it's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9651}{\*\bkmkend ldl9651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a\~lot of amazing people doing a huge amount of good work to make sure that we're trying to push this in the direction we want.  \line GISELE HENRIQUES: I mean it's an excellent question, but we are actually building a different aid industry by being different aid workers we're }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9701}{\*\bkmkend ldl9701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}building a different aid industry.  That's what I like to thinking I am trying to do that I am doing and that I am manifesting.  You have to provide the evidence, so when you provide the evidence of what green hands did in Aceh or what Permatil }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9751}{\*\bkmkend ldl9751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is doing in Timor there's no-one that can deny that.  It's about us also capturing those lessons and sharing them and coming back\~to it.  It's a problematic industry, but what do you do, do you let it be problematic or do you ensure or try to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9801}{\*\bkmkend ldl9801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}play a role so it's, you know, you can harness it's potential rather than letting it be what it is.  \line DECLAN KENNEDY: That sounds a good idea.  Moving right back there \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab  Hi thank you very\~much.  As a very brief in turn in NGOs }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9852}{\*\bkmkend ldl9852}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in Washington DC, I know how frustrating it can be, it's good to know that the industry can have a practical positive affect in communities like that.  \line \tab       As, I\~was just wondering, student very early on in his learning and practice of permaculture, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9901}{\*\bkmkend ldl9901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}there\~are lots of places I want to see and lots of things I want to do but I know how important it is\~to become embedded into community to know that your actions your projects have very real impact on people, but I\~think as someone like me I }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9951}{\*\bkmkend ldl9951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}am more, I apologise, I am more interested in more experienced in the actual practical side, planting, building, projects like that, but to actually help developing countries, indigenous people, communities like this do they really need people who }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10001}{\*\bkmkend ldl10001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}are better versed in the aid industry, and countries like the US or do they need people to show them how to make projects like this and how important it is to have skilled people like that.  \line LACHLAN MCKENZIE: That's a really good question it's important }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10051}{\*\bkmkend ldl10051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}for when you come into a place to realise it's not so much that we're showing them how to be like us, it's about how to make communities stronger in themselves, and we can provide techniques and knowledge which maybe aren't available but it's the way we do }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10101}{\*\bkmkend ldl10101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}it, in Permatil, no foreigners have made decisions about their organisation, about what projects they choose, and about where they work but there's been a\~lot of foreigners come in and help to build the capacity and help to make those projects work better, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10152}{\*\bkmkend ldl10152}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and then say if I came in and did a training I would always have one or 2 other volunteers and people helping me, so that they could then quickly take over and do it themselves.  \line \tab       Also, then, it's up to organisation to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10201}{\*\bkmkend ldl10201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}be decide which projects they actually want to follow and which actually works best in their culture.  I quickly learn to drop my ego about what I could contribute and to allow myself to help at as much as possible to create that strength and\~the that }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10251}{\*\bkmkend ldl10251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}base I learnt some amazing stuff and I never thought I would be doing over there but it really was about realising we can contribute, it's about finding a way to do it that actually allows the local, the community and to actually make }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10301}{\*\bkmkend ldl10301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}those decisions about where they want to do and providing than the information there's so much information you need a tractor, you need to do this, you need to do that.  We can come and say we need to be like Australia's agriculture, the first }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10351}{\*\bkmkend ldl10351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}thing issue are agriculture system in Australia I explain what has happened to our environment, do you really want to go down that path or choose something different.  \line GISELE HENRIQUES: What we try\~to do about outlining the different models is show there's different way you can\~get }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10401}{\*\bkmkend ldl10401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}engaged.  For\~me it's always been about being of service how can I be of service.  I happen to be trained in the aid industry, I know how to navigate a log frame, that's where I can be of added value to an organisation like Permatil that }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10451}{\*\bkmkend ldl10451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}doesn't know how to do that but may need those skills in\~order to access some money.  So trying to understand where are your strengths how you can contribute without trying to over run the show because it's not your show.  I really see that from that humbling }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10501}{\*\bkmkend ldl10501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}perspective of how can I be of service.  \line DECLAN KENNEDY: I\~think that's a good point that we finish, I would like to just make the comment that we found in development aid is that David Holmgren's principles as just fantastic because they don't give any rules, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl10551}{\*\bkmkend ldl10551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}they allow the people to find their way within it, and they allow the so called farm supporters to be really supporters and not telling them how to do it.

Talking about soils, seeds and social change in El Salvador specifically.  What we are going to do is just introduce ourselves a bit now and then show a short film that we have made to go in collaboration with people in El Salvador about the movement there and then Karen will talk for a while and then we will open it up for both of our sets of questions together.  Thanks a lot for the two previous talks that were really interesting, you may see relevance in what we are talking about.  My name is Naomi, a permaculture practitioner from Bristol where I also work as a lecturer, and researcher inhumane geography, which is not about mapping the body as people ask me, it's a social science involving connecting together, spatial, environmental and human systems together in different ways, in my case means looking particularly at politically looking at transforming, globalising systems, my main areas of research and teaching are generally around community-managed food solutions, including food sovereignty, mentioned before and community-managed forestry, some of the projects are in the UK, but a number are in Central America, I've been working with Karen since 2012, collaborating and as in other cases I tend to draw on participative or action research methods if any of the words make sense.  In designing what I think the research questions are, I work alongside social movements, community groups and so on to help define what would be useful research so the research can be used as part of meaningful social change at local levels but also, eventually, hopefully at }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:12501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}other sites and settings.  So sometimes I talk about that as a kind of politics of knowledge, looking at the kinds of experience and expertise and understanding that are being developed in particular sites and settings.  Trying to work out what it would mean for those to be translated to other sites or settings or to scale up or have particular kinds of effects.  In El Salvador one of the things that's really shown up is how important the back drop of social movements, civil war, popular education and so on have been to the emergence of permaculture in that setting.  So permaculture in El Salvador is different from permaculture in other settings and that's is really important, it helps us think further about what we think about some of the questions raised in the previous presentation about what is the meaning of development and how do you shift from development to design as a solution to problems that people face. \line \tab       So the film that we are going to show - well the reason that I've chosen to do that instead of have a longer talk, the voices of people involved in the movement, we really wanted to bring those into the room and the film itself isn't strictly a participative film, it's mostly me behind the camera, I'm not a filmmaker but a friend of mine who is has helped me edit it together to tell a kind of a story, but I wanted to bring that with me so the narrative that is being told can be heard through people's own accounts and lots of the themes that come up there are themes that emerged through the workshops that we did together, what they wanted to communicate as meaningful and important knowledge.  Over to Karen. \line KAREN INWOOD:  I'm here representing the Permaculture Movement in El Salvador, you can see I'm not from El Salvador, but I lived there for 12 years and was the Director of One of the founders of the movement and the Director of the permaculture Institute for 15 years up until quite recently.  So, very sorry and sad that my colleague, Reina Mejia, who was on the programme }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}has}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} not been able to attend we couldn't get the finances for her, but she sends her greetings and hopes I can represent them as well as she can.  In the film you will see the faces and voices of the people in the movement, after the film I'll talk about how the movement came into being.  We want to leave quite a bit of time for questions and discussion afterwards.  So I'll leave you to watch the film and the voices from the people of El Salvador.  . \line     \tab \tab \tab \tab \{AV Display - }{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Main Screen}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

The well I hope you find.  This was a project, this was something or rather cooperative, they were all defunct, so permaculture was a fantastic solution, it's proved to be a great solution for building community action and communities solving their own problems, rather than aid pouring in, leaving nothing behind much more than houses and defunct projects.  When I went out there, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:13501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}there was a small group of farmer-to-farmer, farmers.  I should say farmers that were using farmers to farm methodology to pass to each other and to others sustainable ways of farming and living, a very small group.  I went out just having done my permaculture design course, knowing virtually nothing and not speaking Spanish.  What I was able to bring was to bring resources into that movement and to help them think, plan and use design principles to plan their future.  The first thing we did was create an organisation, we needed something to channel money and resources in.  These are subsistence farmers who don't even have the money to travel to talk to each other or share practices and information, so we clearly needed some resources in, and that was the first thing that we did.  Partly, partly with help from the Permaculture Association, thank you Andy.  We got some money initially, there was a terrible earthquake in the first few months after I arrived, we were able to get some funding into help us develop some of the techniques and to find out what worked and we set up some permaculture demonstration communities if you like, as a result of earthquake having destroyed communities we were able to rebuild with that support, but rebuild sustainable communities to act as learning for the movement and also learning for the country, so if you like that was phase 1.  Phase 2 we were able to get some money from the German government, the lottery here and the Methodists in this country, they helped us take the teaching out more widely to use the experience of what we learned in the post earthquake time, we went out to teach, very few people were able to teach permaculture, I couldn't because I didn't have the language, although I was able to contribute a little bit on some of the theory, mostly the farmers didn't have the teaching skills.  So, our next stage was to try and build the capacity of that movement so there was a wider group of people, an ever growing group of people who were able to teach not just practical skills of how you make compost and how you dig swales and so on, but to go beyond that and teach the principles and design techniques of permaculture, that was clearly that was needed, it's mostly the NGOs were teaching people techniques.  Lots of people knew how to make one particular kind compost and lots of people had dug ditches maybe or terraced their land and a lot of the terraces were left not even given maintenance because no money came in after that initial project.  So what we wanted to do was build a }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:14001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}capacity to build a group of leaders and teachers who could go into the communities and support the communities in a long-term and never-ending process of building the kind of community that they wanted and the kind of life that they wanted themselves, rather than passively accepting projects coming from the exterior.  So we needed some support to do that too, that was part of the funding that we got, particularly from the Methodists who accompanied us for nearly ten years through that process.  What we have now and what you were looking at, the film that was made 18 months ago by Naomi, a beautiful film.  What happened in the 18 months since then is that the movement has now become independent, it's, it gave birth to itself, if you like, as a formal movement in January this year.  It separated from the Permaculture Institute which was the original tool that we set up to bring in resources, it's a movement that is now made up of local associations.  There are three, if you like, model Permaculture Associations that we have been spending probably ten or twelve years developing.  Those three associations act as beacons for the rest of the country and in fact the region too. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

At the time, we wanted to create a whole model of what permaculture could achieve at local level.  That meant working, if we could, with all the communities in a particular district.  And working if we could with all the members of the community in all of those communities in the district.  Working with the young people, particularly and with the women, you will see the majority of the people on the film were really quite young and they are now leading the movement forward and they are the ones who are the trained permaculture teachers.  Each community nominates a couple of people, particularly young people to attend design courses and design courses which are held locally so that everybody on the course is studying with people from their own districts, they are starting to }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}build}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} up networks and friendships and close working relationships.  At the end of are course the model now is to set up an association so that people continue to work together and learn together,  that association is made up of representatives of the communities, who then work in the community to support their community to get involved and to practice and then to work with all the local agency within the district, as\~you saw a number of them were }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:14501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}speaking on that film, other agency from Suchitoto, one of the districts we work in.  We are also working to bring permaculture principles into local organisations, civil organisations, NGOs, we now run courses for, I say 'We', speaking on their behalf, I don't live there any more, run courses for their NGOs for their technicians, permaculture has a huge resonance in El Salvador, people are desperate for a solution to how to feed themselves, poverty and food security is a major problem, climate change is massively impacting the region; so taking permaculture as an inspiring, spiritual, cultural and practical solution, it has, echo, echo not just amongst the most vulnerable people in the communities that we work in, but also for the people that work with them, the aid workers and people from the NGOs.  So the potential for really transforming the society is very definitely there, but it's slow steps, it's very important for a movement like that not to run before it walks, everything has to be embedded, people need to feel confident in order to reach out to many more people you need many more teachers and it takes about four years to get somebody from the point of finishing their design course to feeling confident to run a design course.  That's the process that they are involved in now.  We have a demonstration site that acts as the national demonstration site for El Salvador, in which people can see the practices in their more developed form.  More importantly we like to take people into the communities to see the plots of land and the many of thousands of people who are now practising permaculture on their very own small plots of land, tends to be about two acres on average.  So that's the Permaculture Movement.  We wanted to share that with you.  We believe that the best way of changing the society is to actually demonstrate, in practice, the future that we are promoting.  So showing you the film and the voices of the people and their practices, their vision, their enthusiasm, we would like to say to the aid agency and to anybody who is interested in sustainable development, internationally, that there is a very, very good example that we have spent an awful lot of years developing and as there are in many other countries, but this example in El Salvador, we are very pleased that some academics are coming to learn from the people and what they are doing and we invite anybody to.}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

I just wondered if you could just go over again you said how you were working in\~a whole district, you started by getting the communities to nominate a couple of young people from each community, what were the next steps after that?  \line KAREN INWOOD: Perhaps give an example of a district we would be invited into to work we would need\~to\~work in partnership with a civil society organisation in that district an organisation that already got roots in the communities.  We visit the communities along with the organisation and present the idea of permaculture and farmer to farmer methodology, each community as a community association.  El Salvador because of\~the civil war has some amazing participative structures in the community.  We meet with the community association invite them to nominate who they think might be the two most suitable people to bring the learning back\~to them we suggested it's a man and a woman, we hope they will be quite young.  Then the communities that respond\~to that they come on a, those two people come on a permaculture design course, and we run that over nine months or a year we do 2 or three days }{\*\bkmkstart ldl751}{\*\bkmkend ldl751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a month over a long period of time that allows people the opportunity to practice in between time.  It's a very practical course, people's level of education in El Salvador is not great, still an awful lot of illiteracy, but we embed the principles and the theory of permaculture in the practice.  So after a year of working and learning together, we at the end of the course we do an analysis of where next, and what the participants want to do for their district.  Either they set up }{\*\bkmkstart ldl851}{\*\bkmkend ldl851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a local permaculture association, or they are already active in there local civil society organisation which ever doesn't matter but if we're able to and we have the resources then we would a company that organisation for another couple of years we will be teaching a group of people within that district how to teach.  The idea would be leaving behind a local group of the permaculture movement which then links up with the entire movement.  \line \tab       We're still in\~the early stages of that, we have got, we have worked with a couple of NGOs who have brought their members through that process.  \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab  Just wanted to ask the title to do with seeds as well I just wanted to ask whether you had any seed saving and what you were doing I know that GM maize is a problem in America and South\~America, and so I just wanted to know whether you had any seed saving capacity and how you built that up.  \line KAREN INWOOD: Hugely.  Seeds, particularly seeds of maize, because maize of\~course comes from central America and mostly people have been force today plant hybrid varieties, GM is still not widely distributed in El Salvador, seed banks is a big issue.  We see seed banks not as one great big building in El Salvador where we collect together the seeds or put it under the ground like they do in the Arctic, if a community particular families take responsibility for redistributing and storing seeds of particular kinds.  So in\~a particular community there might be a family that have got an awful lot of different vegetable seeds and others have got maize and bean seeds.  Seeds and also native variety of vegetative matter if you like, what we're trying to do on a big scale is bring in alternatives or help people plant what they used to plant before just maize and beans were forced upon them.  Particularly maize and beans, maize in particular is very climate sensitive so we're looking at varieties of food that people used to eat in the past, that might be much more resilient to climate change, so it's a very big part of the movement's work.  \line NAOMI MILLNER: Can I just add something, just to say that one of the things, sorry I am losing my voice, one of the things is\~the massive loss of diversity within species, so maize and beans so on have been round long time but one of\~the legacies in\~the green revolution was\~to narrow massively the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1301}{\*\bkmkend ldl1301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}types of each of those via varieties that were he'd.  Just to join a little anecdote, this understanding diversity is not that new, how\~many people heard of Karl sour before, he\~was a geographer which I why I like him from the 1940s and is generally linked with some of\~the early agroecology movements as well as sub discipline of political ecology you might have heard of.  He\~was consulted in the 1940s by the Rockefeller foundation in partnership with US delegation about their plan for agricultural plan in region the vice-president at the time had gone to visit Mexico had been shocked by the hours of labour that Mexican farmers were putting in, great we can bring in these American systems way of doing this into\~this area that will double production and maximise food security.  They consulted Karl Sauer at the time he\~was like that a stupid idea you have got a huge variety of seeds part of the resilience of the area the economic infrastructure of the whole region is dependent on small scale farming you will end up having to undo all this work.  That was not particularly in vogue at the time.  They didn't really listen to him and basically it's really quite interesting that they sub discipline like agroecology who have emerged out of some of\~the people round Karl Sauer are now part of constructing the solution.  They also had other problems round food security it's about joining those things back together, and a right\~hand seeds is obviously a huge part of that.  \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab  Thank you, I am from Norway I am national co-ordinator of\~a global network, named more and better for better support agricultural in rural }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1601}{\*\bkmkend ldl1601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}development.  I have 2 questions.  First my question is that if you got 10, 15 years back, there were much more fight between different directions you say ok are you permaculture, are you ecologist, organic, sustainable, my impression now is that ok, doesn't matter so much what we call it because more or less we are having the same goal I would like\~to have your viewpoint on this.  \line \tab       The second link to this is for last few years I have been very\~much more attention to agroecology I\~was }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1701}{\*\bkmkend ldl1701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}also on\~the steering committee for global society conference in Mali on agroecology in September.  Also had the first agroecological symposium lass year and now the regional conferences, one Latin America was in Brazil just\~a few weeks ago.  I would like\~to hear your opinion about }{\*\bkmkstart ldl1751}{\*\bkmkend ldl1751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}this now widening movement on a grow ecology and how it's linked to permaculture movement and anyway to join hands on this.  Thank you.  \line KAREN INWOOD: Ok from\~the experience in El Salvador, firstly in El Salvador there has been a small organic movement which is definitely not agroecology in\~the sense it's organic production for export.  The movement I support is clearly not supportive of that.  There\~are lots of civil society organisations that are working with agroecological methods but as I mentioned in the talk it can be very specific to particular techniques, so the joy of permaculture and I\~think what a\~lot of people what it inspires is an understanding that it's not even just agriculture we're interested in it's life.  All the aspects of life.  That looks very different depending on where you\~are.  So if you're in\~a small rural village in El Salvador you need to look at the quality of the water, and you need to look at forestation, you need to look at erosion as well as your food, and that very linked into your health, and the kind of house that you live in and your sanitation, so permaculture looks at all of those aspects which is beyond agroecology.  The experience of El Salvador I am not talking about terminology, but those who would be espousing agriculture in El Salvador would be looking at techniques, so I\~think it's really important that we don't just say permaculture is\~the only system, and we're not interested in anything else, and we spend all our time working, building networks of organisations with common visions even though we might have slightly different techniques, yeah.  \line NAOMI MILLNER: Yeah I would share that view that not to be too precious about particular names, I\~think when you try\~to guard a name you end up guarding more than name which cause a\~lot of problems ultimately, but having different names different systems, does allow people to do different }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2101}{\*\bkmkend ldl2101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}things in different context.  And whenever you \uc1\u8216\'91thingify\uc1\u8217\'92 something you turn it into a system in\~a way of doing something, always runs the tendency that things start sliding round particular power relationships, ways of doing some people are not included so the introduction of permaculture within El Salvador did allow a refreshing of who are the usual candidates getting to be part of this terminology, who could also be part of it how could young people and more women be part of this movement in this way of redesigning things. But that's said, I\~think it's also important that the 2 do have very different family history, permaculture arriving a bit more via Australia and the global north in some ways, agroecology having a really important history in the peasant schools of\~the Africas and Americas, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2253}{\*\bkmkend ldl2253}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and bringing with it that shared memory of struggle which I a very specific experience of the food system and agricultural enclosure in different kinds of ways.  I\~think it's important to think of them together and separately.  \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab  Thank you very\~much for a really fascinating detailed presentation and the film and everything, sorry, wave if you can't hear me.  I am interested in the access to land and the film was indicating the very high population and most of what you have said is related to farming, how\~much has the permaculture and the project you have been involved with been able to access people who don't have access to land, and influence them because there was some indication that there\~was quite a political involvement and that is very interesting as well.  \line KAREN INWOOD: Wow that's a big subject, access to land }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2401}{\*\bkmkend ldl2401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the whole civil war was fought over that.  So, there\~was a\~lot of a big land redistribution, both during and at\~the end of the civil war.  Land is much, was much more available at the end of the war than previously just to give that context.  \line \tab       We have not worked in urban areas, since I first went out there the population had become more urban than rural, it's switched as the whole world has.  I know the movement is dead keen to do working in urban areas, but to\~its do with capacity rather than vision.  In terms of who in the rural areas owns land and doesn't own land, we worked with lots of farmers who rent their land.  There\~was a\~lot of loss of land after the redistribution because people didn't know how to farm it or couldn't keep up the payments and so on.  So there's a large population in the rural areas who are only renting other people's land.  That does have an affect on\~the extent of the practices that people are prepared to take up.  If }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2602}{\*\bkmkend ldl2602}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}you are working somebody else's land you\~are probably not going to dig swales and do huge amount of terraces.  There massive interest from all farmers whether they are owning it or not owning land.  When I first went out there\~was a\~lot of co-operative, there's a very big and interesting story which I won't tell you but there\~are very few co-operatives except in name now.  There's a\~lot of going backwards and from the heady days of after the civil war when co-operatives were set up and land was redistributed and money and objects }{\*\bkmkstart ldl2702}{\*\bkmkend ldl2702}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}came in.  I\~don't\~know if that answers your question.  \line NAOMI MILLNER: Just to add that there\~are I mean I\~think there\~are other examples in central America I am more familiar with where the land struggle issue is more central to this kind of practice, it often happens that the moment around the issue of indigenous rights.  In El Salvador because the indigenous people are so small and the system is sole liberalised.  It's so difficult to frame it in those terms.  It's the main thing that's happening I can talk to you later about other examples in other countries where there even huge struggles and international support to reinstate communal rights within the law in the context where it's moving in\~the opposite direction.  I\~think that's where some of the most interesting and polemic struggles are happening to agroecology and that kind of thing.  \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab  I just want to make a comment really, I live in\~the UK, and I tend to practice small scale urban permaculture.  35 years ago, I was in Kenya very\~much around aid based agriculture which was transported mainly from Europe and North\~America.  In the early part of your speech you mentioned the word "aid" which I\~often linked to GDP and develop countries give aid.  I just wondered whether the root problems is we don't call it aid in this country, we call it subsidies and particularly we are prepared\~to go to any lengthen that we ensure we give cheap food, low-cost food to people and many of\~the population have little understanding about the environmental destruction.  It's a big question, I know, but one of the successful things and encouraging things you are talking about is a society that is in\~a desperate situation at you hear these stories from other countries lack Malawi, Belize as well, I wonder whether the root problem for permaculture is this subsidies that we have in develop countries for cheap food.  \line NAOMI MILLNER: Just to clarify do you mean the root problem for permaculture within this context?  \line FROM THE FLOOR:\tab  Not the context you are talking about why the take up is tends to be so slow in developed countries, as }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3101}{\*\bkmkend ldl3101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}opposed to people that can really see the advantage in their cultural values in countries like you are talking about and El Salvador.   \line KAREN INWOOD: I\~think in El Salvador, permaculture is really about survival or\~not.   That's actually the reason that I want to go\~there, after doing my permaculture design course because I didn't, I wasn't so interested in permaculture in lifestyle terms in the UK, I wanted to go and see how you would apply to\~it almost life and death situation.  So it gets taken up there because it is\~the difference between feeding your family, and not feeding it very well at all and extreme poverty and managing.  That's not the situation for people, it\uc1\u8217\'92s a very different situation in this country, the conditions and the problems here are very different.  I\~don't\~think I am the person to comment on that bit of it because all of my work has been in El Salvador.  Do you want to say something?   \line NAOMI MILLNER: It could be slight polemic I am not sure how it welcome out, I am going to say it's extremely important that we hold our enthusiasm for permaculture }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3301}{\*\bkmkend ldl3301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in\~tension with a history of colonialism to understand the starting point is very different, because the historical legacies are very different when you come to agriculture.  What food sovereignty means is very different in\~a country who's land is cultivate export crops it\uc1\u8217\'92s been force to do that to remain part of department repayment schemes with world bank pressurised to sell off more of it's land but could grow most of\~its crops within it's porters.  That's extremely different from the context where we rely a\~lot on exports which we have historically arranged through various kinds of violent a appropriation, we have lost what it takes to make agriculture work and who's labour involved.  We do have to take a serious look at are history before we start to think about the differences between contexts, but that could help us think about the future of permaculture as well.  \line DECLAN KENNEDY: So I\~think we should begin to wrap up, and I\~think it's been a really good experience, we have how the little bit more time because the 2 of you co-operating, and that we could have this visual input as well.  I suggest we just finish by giving the two of them a good hand and thanking them.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  \line \tab       So, we've gone over the half an hour that was organised by the organisers, so that there\~isn't so much of a push down in the eats, so I offer you now lunch and off you go \line \tab       (Lunch).   }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

We're going to start off now with the first afternoon session you are all here in the right place for forest gardening, so we have\~got three exciting presenters lined up, Chris Warburton-Brown, Sagara, and Jerome Osentowski I will say a little bit more about each one of them when it's their turn \line \tab       So we have three presentations each one will\~be between, about 20 minutes.  Then there will be 10 minutes time for questions after each one.  Jerome has a\~lot to pack in he's one of the most interesting people in\~the world to talk about forest gardening so he will get an extra five minutes but there will still be 10 minutes for questions, and so if you need to rush off at the end of\~the session, you might want to leaf a little bit earlier but IM sure you will be all glued to your seats for that.  \line \tab       Right so we're starting off with Chris Warburton-Brown he's part of the team that spent the last year or so writing up some research on baseline survey of forest gardens.  Chris is\~the research co-ordinator of the Permaculture Association so he will tell you all about what he got up to there.  \line CHRIS WARBURTON-BROWN: Ok thanks Tomas, that's great.  \line \tab       Yeah, so, I\~don't\~know if anyone has seen this guy round the place a bit of a dodgy looking character but I believe he's circulating.  \line \tab       This is\~the them the four of us doing the survey we're currently writing it up hoping to get it }{\*\bkmkstart ldl3851}{\*\bkmkend ldl3851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}published in the new year.  Really Tomas we don't want to make this into a complete mutual admiration session but Tomas was in instrumental to this project really his inspiration and idea behind it so all credit to him.  There he is.  \line \tab       Naomi who works at\~Cumbria university she also the founder of the food network she managed to secure a small amount of money from Cumbria university to support this work.  Can everybody hear me ok?  Cool.  \line \tab       Emma is Emma here?  No.  Yes.  Emma hi.  I knew I had not seen you.  Emma from Exeter university who is researching raspberry production in forest gardens.  She is supported by the research council.  Me, not my favourite photograph of myself I am the permaculture research co-ordinator and for the last 3 years I have been leading the Permaculture Association's 10 year forest garden research project, that's a separate one to which am going\~to talk about today, but that the forest garden work I\~was doing for I got involved in this piece of work.  \line \tab       This is a collaborative effort, we put together data from 3 different surveys which were conducted between 2011 and the end of 2014, of forest gardens in the temperate zone and you would be amazed how difficult it to get a clear definition of the temperate zone the data we have analysed includes northern Italy the east and west coast of north America, but not the bottom pits of either America or Spain, we have included New Zealand and the very south-east corner of Australia, we have included Canada although I might say that the snow zone and all of central and northern Europe.  That's where the gardens in this survey come from.  \line \tab       Some of them come from Cumbria, that's definitely temperate.  They conducted a survey both online and physically, the main body of\~the survey was Survey Monkey that Tomas created and ran in 2014.  Tomas then went on a kind of tour, grand tour of forest gardens last year and added some more data to survey.  So in total we found over 160 forest gardens giving us some data.  After a lot of filtering and sieving we had enough data to include in the survey.  Some had just given us an address and a name.  \line \tab       Not surprisingly considering all four of the people involved are UK based the survey more this is by number not percentage, more than half of\~the gardens are in the UK, very widely spread from Cornwall to Scotland.   Got a reasonable number in Europe and in USA and Canada at one other which is in New Zealand.  \line \tab       We were very pleased with how there seems to be an exponential growth.  In 1980 none of\~the gardens existed, every one of the forest gardeners has come into existence since 1980.  This green bar is only the first four years of\~the 2010s, so assuming we carry on\~the green bar will be off the top of\~the scale by the time we get to 2019.  If you look at the number of forest gardens in our survey the first 5, if we can imagine zero in 1980, the first 5 in existence by 1990, so on, so you can see the huge growth.  I did some rough figures for what this exponential growth would mean if it carried on to 2100, it\~was something like half a million, if this carries on we will have about half a million forest gardens by 2100.  That's pretty good.  Forest gardens seem\~to be going places.  \line \tab       We classified the gardens as private, community, or commercial.  You see the roughly speaking half of them are private and a quarter community, and nearly a quarter commercial, and then there's a few which identified as covering more than one of those goals.  \line \tab       So private garden is basically someone\uc1\u8217\'92s back garden or own personal piece of land, not that they don't let other people on to\~it but it's theirs.  Community garden is something run and owned for the benefit of the community , a commercial garden is existing to be a commercial money making enterprise.  \line \tab       We had roughly even split between farm and rural areas and urban areas.  We had massive range in size which was yeah one of the most challenging things to try to analyse, size range between 5 square metres and 30 hectares, so 5 square metre is not much bigger than the platform I am standing on, 30 hectares are obviously massive, some are tiny, we have\~got a real spread with 6 sites covering more than 5 hectares.  The median and mode is one acre, because large because people told is it\~was an acre in size so it's not very accurate.  \line \tab       So Tomas has suggested that maybe the term forest garden is not really the right term or should split the term so we're playing with the idea of forest garden, food forest, forage forest, forage gardens been the really big ones, over 5 hectares.  \line \tab       We also asked about people's goals, and }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4801}{\*\bkmkend ldl4801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}this is a scale on which if everybody in the survey said that food self reliance was their top goal it would score 1.  If everybody said that food self reliance was their least important goal it would score 6.  So the lower the number the more important this is.  \line \tab       So we have a\~very clear split I\~think between the first 3, food self reliance biodiversity and education, and second 3, commercial production and what was scribe as other.  49 told us the most common was fun which is }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4901}{\*\bkmkend ldl4901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}nice, some people want to have fun from their forest garden.  There\~was a\~huge list of things that people are motivated by, harvesting medicine, connection with the land, self education, relaxation, figuring at what works and why, fodder crops, nursery, having }{\*\bkmkstart ldl4951}{\*\bkmkend ldl4951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a hobby, rest, growing basket making materials, camping.  So people are excited about forest garden four massive range of reasons I have not put all of them on there.  \line \tab       Then we asked people to rate their goals again in\~a similar scale, 1 everybody }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5001}{\*\bkmkend ldl5001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is absolutely delighted, it's wonderful, much better than they could ever have imagined and 4 is really we didn't meet that goal at all.  Interestingly, the top goal by biodiversity that was rated second when people said what is\~the most important goal.  So biodiversity is delivering what people want, people say they want biodiversity from their garden and they get it but the one that people wanted most was food self reliance, that's coming way down the list in what's it's actually to\~live ring.  People suggested that expectation of biodiversity yes we're getting there, education seems pretty could as well but food self reliance not so could people are not really happy with the food self reliance they are getting from their garden, and even worse, commercial production people are not happy with the degree of commercial success they are getting from their garden.  \line \tab       Naomi is doing some very complex analysis of the most common species and the species groups, as general combination, we will map that against climate areas in different parts offer the world how does North America differ from Cumbria for\~example, but are initial analysis suggests that perhaps unsurprisingly everybody has apple trees.  That seems to be the\~only plant that actually is across all forest gardens people have is apple.  \line \tab       Plum, pear, cherry and hazel are next, blackberries and currants do well in the shrubs, very interestingly a pat from apples not a single species is grown by more than half the gardeners.  Perhaps to me the most interesting thing so\~far is massive diversity of plants being grown.  Huge range well over 200 species can't less varieties, I\~should have had a little forest garden Oscar to give out\~to Graham, he\uc1\u8217\'92s down there, he managed to\~achieve 224 different varieties listed on his list yeah we'll give him a round of applause that's pretty amazing.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  Very interestingly }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5352}{\*\bkmkend ldl5352}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}if any one\~is looking for a nice academic study to do, the other winner of the Oscar for most varied garden is\~the reading international solidarity centre roof garden they have more than 200 species on a roof which I\~think is fascinating.  I really didn't think we }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5401}{\*\bkmkend ldl5401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}would have forest gardens on a roof.  We have not got everybody here from RISC have we?  What a shame.  In their absence we will give them their award.  \line \tab       Hours worked per week, I\~think this is an area that needs a\~lot more research, because the results are so varied.  Some people are putting in 1 hour or less a week, some people are putting in 20 or more hours a week so there's a huge spread.  Obviously we need\~to\~map this against the size of\~the garden. If you have got a garden that 5 square metres it might not be surprising you are putting in one hour a week, if you have got 35 hectares it might be at the other end.  Very interesting to see how this maps against size, whether some people are running a big space doing very little labour vice versa.  We'll wait and see where this take us. We have several questions which need more analysis, most common species, needs a lot more work, it's so varied.  It would just be great to have a list of the species }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:15001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in all the forest gardens that we have surveyed the guild which we haven't analysed yet, people's biggest challenges which they were asked just to describe what their biggest challenge was and the biggest lesson they have learnt, we are looking forward to getting some stuff from that, hopefully practical advice to pass on to new forest gardens.  Anyone here who is running a forest gardens in the temperate zone, the survey is still live on Survey Monkey, have a look.  Yeah, how do people find the link Tomas, is it still live?  . \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Through.... \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  Is it still alive on the association website. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Under, "Questions", it comes up.  There is, it doesn't work at the moment, which took it off line because we wanted a clear, defined... we will create a new survey, which we will more widely publicise. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  Ok, so we have taken it down in order to do the analysis of the first lot, then there will be a second generation, if you want to do the survey you will have to hold on a little bit further.  Getting the findings published, which we think we would like to do in an academic journal, we would like to think, someone will correct me, we would like to think it's the first academic work on temperate forest gardens published in a journal, we are quite excited about that. \line \tab       Almost all the participants, we are happy to say, said they would be happy to work with us again, we will do new and deeper survey, we have a much better idea now of where the interesting questions need to be teased out and more subtlety explored in the questions.  Of course everybody, specially the members of the team need to read Tomas' book, which will appear, if you are a forest garden enthusiast, Tomas is not allowed to plug his own book, so I will sneak do it for him, when is it out - ok, not so imminently.  This is in north Yorkshire, which some of you might know, I guess we have lots from the conference, those of us in the temperate zone will be going home to harvest, I was harvesting my apples I hope }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}get a}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} knowledge and friendship from the conference, I wish you a very happy, Blackberry, Apple, harvest when you return to your little patch of land.

So, now, there will be time for questions.  It would be great - do we have steward?  Stephanie will come around and if you raise your hand then ask your question and please be succinct with your question, so short question and, or a short statement followed by a question.  Thank you very much. }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:15501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Chris will try to answer. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  I shall try. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Here is a question. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  If you would like to same your name and where you are from as well. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  Hi. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Please stand up, say your name. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Steve, Kansas city, I wonder if you would ask how many hours at the age, each age of the garden. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  A great question.  I think, umm... what we have discovered from this survey, like the plants, the update from the survey is absolutely fantastic and really detailed, in a sense by the time it's all analysed we will have a very clear picture of the plants people are growing and the guilds they are growing them in and stuff, but interesting things like how\~much time people are putting in and when, the relationship between the age of the garden, like you say, the size of the garden and the effort, so we have - this survey cannot answer those questions, what it can say is, that's really interesting and we've identified that as something we need to explore further the next survey, having done plants I don't know about other people in the team, we have enough data on plants now, it's exactly the kind of question how much labour do you put in, has that any feeling towards what people are harvesting, what this learning from that, how does that relate to the age of forest gardens.  One thing we need to think about in that is how we are defining labour.  One of the reasons we have such a huge diversity, if I think about the work I put into my garden, Sunday morning I went out with the kids and harvested the apples, it didn't really feel like work, it was just something we did as a family in the sunshine, we need to explore a bit the community gardens versus the communal gardens, they are probably answering the question in a very different way, that's definitely on the list for the next stage. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Margaret, UK, I was just relating the last question, also the time of year, because, for example, I spend a lot of time in the winter pruning, but not in the summer.  A question, you know, how much time do I spend per\~week would be very difficulty to answer. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  Methodology question, did ask people for the four seasons how much time they put in, but most people said the same, we thought we would generate that data, but the fast number of people who put ten in spring, put it in summer and autumn as\~well, we need to ask the question in a different way to tease out the answer, a few people said ten hours in the winter, fifteen in the summer, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:16001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}maybe in your case the other way round, not enough to give a sample we could analyse, we need to ask the question in a much more subtle and clear way, to ask people, be more realistic about the difference between autumn, summer and winter, for myself I\~have a very vague idea I would struggle to say how many hours I put in, maybe if you are doing it commercially, you have an idea, those are very difficult questions to answer for people. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Other questions?  Hi, my name is Jessie from Santa Barbara California, one of my questions would be: do you guys have a specific goal for this survey so far as the metrics on whether forest gardens are financially viable, commercial viable and then for the food security part, is it would security for one person, a community, a bioregion, stuff like that, so trying to get differentiation of what people are after and if its viable. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  In the broadest sense, yes, we would like to answer all those questions.  I guess what has happened with this, we have kind of, or Tomas really has just chucked a big net out there and see which }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}fish}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} end up in our net the plant data we have got is really, really good, a lot of the questions you were asking were answered, or asked, were answered if at all broadly in the survey.  I think we have done, 127 gardens is enough for us to say there is some interest in this the graph that shows the exponential growth shows there will be more interest in this and somebody needs to get the ball rolling in getting the research community to start thinking about forest gardens.  I think if Tomas and I had a wish list and Emma and Naomi, probably 20 different academic papers could come out of forest gardens easily, so that's the work of us and a lot of other people to sign up for that.  I think what we are going to do is put a marker down with this paper and say, temperate forest gardens out there, very interesting and they're growing in numbers and people ought to really be doing some research on them.  Emma is doing sir research on raspberry production, that's an interesting thing, and other people who will hopefully join up and want to look at some of those commercial aspects, yield aspects all that stuff.  There is a kind of general wish to do all of that, but it will take us a while to get round to that.  Tomas do you want to say something?  . \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Yeah, maybe to add to that, this was a baseline survey, so what we are really doing is establishing who does what, what }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:16501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and a bit of detail to that.  Doing that baseline survey with a lot of practitioners who basically are not specialist researchers, you know you can only do so deep otherwise people just won't bother filling it in.  So we decide, ok, we gather this data and in some ways it's an offer, or in some other way a provocation to the permaculture community, ok, so here is some data now, some baseline data and it asks as many questions as it gives answers, hopefully asks more questions and one of those is the one you asked me.  So anybody who has got a will to follow any of those questions is very much encouraged to do so, and the data that we gathered we asked we can pass that on, so most of the sources data we use for this survey is available to people doing research, so do get in touch with Chris and we can make, make a lot of that data available.  Then, then you can follow your own specialist questions and can get more depth to it.  The second survey that we hopefully can get on to will iron out some of the snags that we discovered with the first survey and hopefully we can also do a follow-on survey that people can fill in every year or every thee years, how are you getting on with yields, your species health and so on. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  My email is research@permaculture.org.uk.  If you go to the research tab you will find me very easily. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Someone there in the middle there.  . }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

When it came to meting goals I thought that was a really good question, what are you goals and did you meet them, I was interested, was that a statistic difference between the numbers, they looked pretty similar, even if you ordered them, 1.53, 1.59, they are similar numbers. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  Those are, but if you look at - what was the one that was, food Self-reliance one, you will see there is a massive differences between that and biodiversity, people can only answer 1, 2 or 3. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  I thought---. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  The top one, that's neither here nor there, the first two, people said food Self-reliance was clearly their top goal and they said they are not agree having that, conversely the biodiversity. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  You have one sir passes expectations, four fails to meet expectations, 2, or maybe 2.5 meets expectations, I wonder if you are being hard there, it pretty much meets expectations. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  The question we asked on that score, the scoring was---. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  The scoring was exceeds expectation as 1, 2, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:17002"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is meets expectations.  3 is, 3 does not fulfil expectations and four doesn't. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  Anything over 2, that is not a good score. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  That's useful clarity, yeah. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  Thank you Tomas, anything other 2 people are pretty happy, anything over 2 that's not looking so good. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  I'm being charitable I suppose, people's expectations on Self-reliance are often pretty high. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  That needs teasing out, yes. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  That's really interesting to have that. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  Thank you, absolutely. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Next question, more questions? }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

I'm interested in potentially the one that you haven't analysed, the challenges.  Our experience is that some of the plants that you put in the ground cover is completely destroyed by the leaf litter and the raspberries are very productive but they go mouldy before you have had a chance to eat them.  Presumably you will be analysing it in more detail. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  Yes, we asked for that as a qualitative, rather than a quantitative answer, people answered anything they like, which is why - at this stage to do any proper analysis - I mean we can put a list, 60 people said this and 4 people said that, it's just going to be a huge list, it's something we can go back to now we know what's emerging as the problems, we will }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}be}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} able to produce a big list, slugs and deer have come out as the absolutely two big things, there might be one person that just said two things on there and it might be quite interesting.  Yeah, it's something we need to give some thought to and explore in more depth.  The things that won't greatly surprise anyone, anyone who has done any forest gardening will know, if you have deer or rabbits you are really in trouble, if you have slugs that's pretty annoying as well.  And then other things like access to vandalism, who owns the land, all those things.  If you read The Land magazine it's in there all the time, the problems that people have, falling out with neighbours, all those things. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Ok, we have time for one more question. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  I find it very interesting and I'm wondering about the geographical region that you have so many UK results and then quite a few in Europe and then a lot less beyond that.  Are you interested in, like, expanding that region or do you have reasons why certain reasons, I didn't hear anything from Russia for example, or Eastern European. \line CHRIS WARBURTON BROWN:  It's a great question, it's just like we chucked a net out there and saw which fish came in the net, being in the UK, Cumbria is best represented, Cumbria - running the Cumbria forest food network, if you look at a map you would think }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:17501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}10% of the forest gardens in the world are in Cumbria, that's obviously ridiculous - \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} - although it could be, maybe it's forest garden paradise. ** }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

Take it away.  \line SAGARA: Thank you Tomas.  Hello everyone.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  My immediate feelings are one of being a fraud, because I never actually studied permaculture.  I am giving a talk at a permaculture conference but I have done all these other things }{\*\bkmkstart ldl5901}{\*\bkmkend ldl5901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}I have done self directed study on permaculture, I have some permaculture course come\~to visit me, I have had permaculture volunteers in my garden.  I don't feel that much of\~a fraud.  Oh excuse me.  \line \tab       The garden of complete being, I\~suppose just unfold that as I go I have not written anything out I am relying on getting into a state of flow so all my material comes out in\~a poetic and clear way.  \line \tab       So just feels to me that we live in these really interesting times, there's big changes upon us, this is a bit of\~a clich\'e9 now but there's a Chinese term for change which includes these two components danger and opportunity, and I am sure we can all feel that.  I\~think my message to everybody is that or to explore what the opportunities are at this time.  To me it just feels like things are so, the changes bearing down upon us are so extreme, that we have nothing to lose by doing what we need to do.  Just to get out there and, well, I call it let's make paradise, but let's make paradise in response to these situation that confronts us.  I suppose this is very\~much the inspiration that lies behind my own project is to try\~to reimagine what the world could look like, outside of this existing paradigm and to give other people as an example of what might be possible.  Because if I make paradise and everybody else in this room makes paradise we start to encourage other people that it might be possible for them as well.  \line \tab       I have had some very encouraging news recently I go\~to some festivals and talk about forest gardening, I have e-mails from people recently from people saying you know what I heard your talk at this festival, and you really made me see it\~was possible to do this.   We have actually just gone out and bought 4 acres of land a few people have said that I felt very encouraged to get that feedback.  \line \tab       So I guess yeah this is\~the question of well what kind of changes could we make I\~think I have kind of already covered that at least from }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6301}{\*\bkmkend ldl6301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}my point of view.  We can really let our imaginations rip and actually just ask ourselves what kind of world would I like\~to live in.  I can't change the world I can be change the world but I can maybe change an acre or half an acre of I can change my back garden into an example to other people of what we can do.  So just to show live by example, live by the world we would like\~to live in, to make that world into and invite other people to come and share that world with us.  \line \tab       I find this turns into a very inspiring opportunity, rather than feeling overwhelmed and power less I can't do anything, I can just assure you from my own experience that people get a huge amount of inspiration from seeing inspiring responses to these difficult situations.  \line \tab       I am just telling you what I have just told you.  Yes so don't focus on what's wrong, but just see what you can do with what you have got, whatever resources you have got, just try\~to make a change from that place.  \line \tab       Yeah to reimagine what it means to be a human being on this limited planet.  I find this is a really important issue.  For\~me, it's reimagining what it means to be human on quite a philosophical level it's like for\~me as I have done this project I really start to feel the incredible abundance that nature offers us.  We have been given from nature, you could say from Gaia, if you want to anthropomorphise it somewhat, we have given the air we breathe the water, all\~the food we eat comes into is passes through us and Gaia had given us all this without charge.  We give it away again.  So it seems like the universe is really one of generosity, it comes to us through us in\~a way it's our responsibility to be generous and pass it back.  \line \tab       I feel that as a response to generosity that I receive an attitude that really important is one of generosity or gratitude to feel grateful for this abundance that nature bestows a upon us.  I\~think without the attitude of gratitude, it's kind of a relationship of exploitation.  So this is becoming more and more important for\~me to try to cultivate this attitude of gratitude.  \line \tab       Ok so I visited Bali\~in my early 20s I could, be here for ever talking about how it changed me I have\~got less than 20 minutes.  I can imagine what the person is doing, ooh what's happened?  Ok so this is someone in\~a\~field making an offering in Bali,\~she is placing herself in relationship to the world round her and her attitude of gratitude.  For\~me another motivation is Buddhism and ecology, there's lots of correlations I feel between the 2 and one is of interconnection between things.  \line \tab       Now the trouble is unless we have }{\*\bkmkstart ldl6851}{\*\bkmkend ldl6851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the right mental states we don't actually perceive these interconnections it's just a concept actual idea.  Buddhism and the idea of medical dating we start to have the mental states where we see the interconnection.  Between things.  I have noticed that my own project when things go wrong it's often because I have not seen interconnections and therefore I have missed something and it's gone wrong.  So for\~me, making a forest garden is kind of spiritual bra demanding me\~to see and perceive the experience the interconnected nature of\~the world.  \line \tab       Ok I am going\~to rush on a bit.  I\~don't\~know what's going on here... seems like a\~lot of my slides are\~missing.  They are all\~the slides on my project.  \line TOMAS REMIARZ: Talk us through.  \line SAGARA: I will talk you through.  Ok so my project - I will talk it through.  So my project is a 3 acre forest garden which started as a bare, empty field.  So I have got a bit of an iconic slide of imagine a gate, stretching hand is 3 acre field with absolutely nothing on it but grass, a grass paddock.   So there\~was this delight full kind of agonising blank canvas experience of what do we do with this blank field.  \line \tab       So, my design process is by one of conversation, I just allow myself not\~to know.  We have a conversation we don't have }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7101}{\*\bkmkend ldl7101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}an idea of how the conversation is going to flow, starting with bare field.  The first thing we did was plant our Hungarian rye grass that grows about 8 feet tall organic matter in the ground that it gave time to imagine a design that was inspiring.  So }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7152}{\*\bkmkend ldl7152}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}what happened was we started by we made some earth banks using a digger, first up, and these banks were about this high, and immediately we noticed after the last frost of the year, very hard frost behind and no frost in front.  Just by the simple act we were able to extend the growing season.  This led to\~an idea of creating earth banks throughout the whole property, we have got all these circular south facing banks that capture the sun and make these much warmer microclimates.  They don't just do that they create outdoor living rooms, as\~much smaller space that individual up what was a flat field into the earth bank surrounded spaces that make it very intimate.  That invites a journey through the landscape, it feels like you are walking through a labyrinth, so people come there and you think is this 10 acres, and I say no\~it's three.  They think it's much, much bigger than what it actually is.  \line \tab       It create an intimacy to the environment which I very enjoyable.  Right in the centre is basically a triangle shape piece of land it's about the size of a swimming pool.  It's surround by earth banks, all\~the earth works that come out of the pond surround the pond.  They create much bigger more micro climates about 9 foot tall these banks.  We make alcoves into the banks, line them with rocks, so in the summer time, the water temperature in the pond is about 20 to 24 degree's constantly radiating day and night, this worms the micro climate round the pond.  I\~don't\~know if any of you have researched }{\*\bkmkstart ldl7452}{\*\bkmkend ldl7452}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the kind of plant you can grow in this country a lot of them marginal for this climate.  If you can nudge the temperature by a degree or 2, each degree you raise the temperature is equivalent of going 300 miles further south.  Just anecdotally it's feels like another season when you walk into this area round the pond so we are starting to grow really interesting plants.  I\~don't\~know how successful that will\~be.  \line \tab        Actually, just coming here today, on the bus, near my friend's place where I stayed, I saw a banana tree, guess what, there were bananas on the banana tree, in London!  Isn't that cool!

So anything that has yielded this year, so we're in the fifth year now, I've just been very, very impressed with the yields I've been getting.  I don't know if it's just this particular year or what ever, but I've been astonished actually.  So, yeah, I suppose really my, the forest garden that I've made, it's not just about growing food and I'm nicking this from Invercoombe, it's about growing people really, I'm focused on this idea of what other needs we have has human beings, we have all those other needs, it was on one of the slides, Maslow's hierarchy of needs, physical needs to be met, emotional needs, needs for beauty, community needs, needs for spiritual up lift, if all the needs are met in the environments that we live in, a lot of the problems we face would disappear, perhaps we wouldn't need to }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:18001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}have consumerism, if we felt, full and nourished human being, we wouldn't have the strange paradigm we have now that makes us feel empty so we have to fill the emptiness with buying stuff.  The visitors I\~have, they leave saying, "I feel like I've been on retreat, like I've been here a month", so time does funny things in the garden.  Any way, you can see I can go on and on, it's called East Devon Forest Garden, you can look me up on Facebook, I'm always happy to have volunteers, my plans for the future is to start running courses based on the idea of the garden of complete being.  So, yes, I will be teaching about forest garden but I also want to run retreats and I'm a photographer, I can run photography courses and things like that.  So we cover the whole spectrum of our lives, exploring how we can deepen and feel nourished in these different ways and make the world a different place even if it's only in three acres and people can go out and spread that message. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Thank you very much \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}.  Right, so that, we have sometime for questions.  So anybody, questions?  Aha, yes. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Only a quick one, where can I find pictures of your banks, they sound really interesting?  . \line SAGARA:  You can find them on my Facebook page, I think you live in axe minister, is that right. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Tring. \line SAGARA:  You can come and visit. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  I'll hold you to that, it's fascinating. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Sorry about the technical hitches with the power point, open office and PowerPoint don't like talking to each other.  Any other questions. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  I'm from the south of France, we have the climate you have now in your garden I think. \line SAGARA:  Yes. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  I made also a pond myself, I made the project the same as you, but on my scale, - from the Himalayas in my pond, maybe we can exchange some plants. \line SAGARA:  I would appreciate that. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Irilara Simosa.  . \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Any other questions, over here?  In your, sorry. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  In your pond are you also doing any kind of fish }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}specie}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}s in there, is this project more for personal enrichment or are you also looking to - do you sell to any markets out of your system. \line SAGARA:  Ok, so first question is, what was the first question? }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}
\pard\plain\ltrpar\ql\sb100\sa100\s31\sl360\slmult1\itap0{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\abinodiroverride\ltrch FROM THE FLOOR:  Fish.... \line SAGARA:  No we don't have fish, it's kind of like a recreational place, gardens that are most successful are the ones people are most happy hanging out in, people come to }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:18501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the pond and they just never end, they are there for hours on end, it really draws people into the garden, I can really see what a difference that has made.  If I had fish in it you wouldn't really be able to swim in it, so that's the first thing.  Then, basically, I'm A one man band, I'm managing a three acre site and I\~have a health issue which really prohibits from farming it actually, so that's why I'm designing myself a role which can continue into the future, which is being teacher.  Hopefully other people will perhaps come in and take on the - there is an opportunity for others to take up those possibilities, I'm not this counting it, but not really.  In the pond I am growing quite a few edible species of plant which is interesting. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Ok. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  More questions?  . \line FROM THE FLOOR:  As a manager, how many do you get to work on the land.  Do\~you\~find that you need quite a lot of people to look after that three acres?  . \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  The question is like, how many people, like how much effort to you put in, how many people does it take. \line SAGARA:  I'm in year five now, I've completed the development works pretty much, I could get away now with just mowing it once every two weeks, I could }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}be}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} there on my own, but that's not much fun, I enjoy having people in, to be there and watch them, not to watch them, but to participate with them on voyage or discovery, I\~have people in, not because I need that, but because it's a shame for the garden not to be used in that way.  Yes. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  I'm from Cornwall, you say you have something like 600+ species can you tell me what sort of sources you have used for those, whether you have done it from seed or nurseries, or purchased the actually plants. \line SAGARA:  I've done it every possible way, I made a hit-list of things I wanted in there and just found them one way or another, royal horticultural society seed search, eBay, I've propagated stuff, imported stuff, you name it, I've done it.  Basically I've hunted stuff down wherever I could find it or swapped stuff with friends, that's another way. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Any other questions?  I've got a question.  Without going, you know, into personal details too much, but I'm quite interested with designing with health in mind, specially with people growing older or people with particular health conditions, what sort of considerations would you say can go into that?  . \line SAGARA:  Well I - I guess this conversational approach that }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:19001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}I've got, I have an open question, I don't have answers, because I do have the health issues, I've kind of realised, I\~have lower layers of my forest garden to develop, I kind of feel I've done my bit, I think hey, here's an opportunity to collaborate with other people.  So like, could I not invite a herbalist to come along and take on the whole of that design or layer and that could be a business for them in the overall thing.  I'm trying to think of this thing, well to acknowledge I\~have limitations but to use it as a possibility to forge new kinds of relationships.  The funny thing is, this garden never had a purpose in the beginning, other than, I want to do some lyrical in response to the problems.  You see what I'm saying, I\~have a health history, what can I too, if that's makes sense. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Yes, thank you.  More questions from the audience?  Over there.  Yes. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Jo from Canterbury.  Hi, what's your favourite plant in the garden?  . \line SAGARA:  Oh gosh!  My favourite plant... mmm...... I'm having to think.  Well I've just discovered, well I can't remember the name of it, which is embarrassing.  It's a water plant that has the flavour of lemon, orange rind, zest.  It's quite intense, does anyone know what it is, it's just fabulous in a salad, on its own it's too much, you put it into a salad and it just brings it alive, it makes it the most amazing experience, that's my favourite discover. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Is it the Vietnamese fish mint, is it that one, a marginal, very pretty!  . \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Vietnamese fish mint, is that right? }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

Paul from the Seattle area in the US.  We have bumped into a lot of problems with spacing of trees.  I was wondering what your take on that is.  You also mentioned mowing, I wonder if you have found any successful strategy for dealing with running crashes and their attempts to thwart other plantings. \line SAGARA:  Just remind me of the first question. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Spacing of trees and such. \line SAGARA:  I've got big boards, you would have seen on the slides - \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} - scale model of my site, on my hit list of plants I made a circle of the diameter of their maximum size and then pinned them on the board with the correct spacings in mind.  I kept doing it and redoing it again and again, so that's the first thing.  Secondly, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:19503"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}after my green manure, what I did was I planted a transitional grand cover of nutrient recycling plants, it's a mixture you can buy here in this country.  What I've discovered is if you plant it very thickly it suppresses a lot of the grasses, in fact in some areas there is a bit of bare soil, nothing has got in the way.  The nutrients, when you are mowing around the trees, you are adding mineralised clippings, the moisture in, all the different affects, suppressing the rigorous grasses I would recommend doing that to anybody. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Thank you, last question over there. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  My name is Vala from Iceland, you said you grew Hungarian rye grass, was that all over the garden. \line SAGARA:  It was, yes. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Then you mowed it into the soil. \line SAGARA:  Yes. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Were there no plants in the garden, or did you take them out, were there no plants when you started. \line SAGARA:  There were, we did actually plough it, it was a three acre site. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  You took away all the plants that there were and planted Rye grass. \line SAGARA:  The benefits of that were astonishing. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Did you compost it first. \line SAGARA:  I rotivated and planted nutrient cycles. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  That's all we have time for, we have another swap over, talk to your neighbours, talk about your own site and what you are working with, what questions you have from this presentation. \line SAGARA:  I'm really glad the slides weren't there so you can use your imaginations \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}.  }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

We have forest gardens.  This talk will be on succession.  This talk will\~be on succession, I have had the privilege to walk under salt Basalt mountain in my back yard, it's pretty much undeveloped I get\~to look at all the ecosystems and all the systems and the natural forest that are there, what discovered it's actually just a pile of rocks with something veneer of vegetation.  As you can see the lichen\~is eating away on\~the rocks and a few squirrels.  And a couple of Douglas first, they take over\~the springs and scrub oak encroaches everywhere I\uc1\u8217\'92m a big farm of Eckhart Toll he knows how to talk about nature his rocks have something to tell us, and so we take a\~lot of time out for hugging rocks and walking through the sage, and doing aromatic therapy I\~am sure the deer do that too, take a nibble here or there.  \line \tab       My favourite place is in the as pen groves.  This is where we really get our inspiration for forest gardens where we look at the models of how the natural world grows and what the combination are how they interact and co-operate.  The over storey and mid-story.  This another shot of a very lush spring coming down I love to just stand there and listen to water, take it all in, and then once you embrace and once you accept that nature accepts you, and you're not alone.  If this is\~the mountain is a mother this is\~the vagina here.  This is a forest garden is, this is my succession from 1988, and you can see we started out with annual production, with a\~lot of salad greens.  You can see the soil I started with this a 1 acre, my first greenhouse and in front of that we grew spinach, planted then we went into basil and lot of salad greens we did all\~the research and development.  You eat in the market now we learn a\~lot we grew alternate crops every year in this simple cloches.  It\~was zone 3 back then, now we're zone 6 I have some zone 7 areas in my forest garden just from a creating microclimates.  In fast forward to today, the forest garden is bursting out over the entire one acre, the centre piece is my new greenhouse which is tropical, and the passive solar home, there's another green house attached which is Mediterranean, and there\~is a PV system up there, and again the landscape a right\~hand me has not changed but we have built soils over the last 20 years.  These are some of the gills, every terrace has a different guild, there's an over story , a mid-storey, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8103}{\*\bkmkend ldl8103}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}medicinal plants, perennial vegetables, hollyhocks for bringing in\~the bees.  This our Mediterranean greenhouse, and in front of that we plant, medicinal plants, in the east side we have 4 different grapes trellised spill over in the greenhouse, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8152}{\*\bkmkend ldl8152}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}and on the right side is all the forest garden guilds and they spill over to fence line all\~the way down, over the fence down 80 foot ravine down into the spring.  So it's there's a\~lot of abundance, and we just can't, we actually had\~to use machetes this year to get in and clear out some of\~the, it's like here in the tropics, this at 7200 feet.  Inside the forest garden is a fig forest, we\~get 5 month of figs and the figs intercept the solar radiation so there's no cooling problems, for the solar house, and the greenhouse and we\~get 50 figs to propagate every year from this.  So the fig trees are better solar collector than the PVs on\~the roof.  Because they are only 30% efficient, this about 300% efficient in collecting the solar radiation.  We have a small pond which creates a another micro climate, the ducks are swimming in their dinner, the duck weed, on\~the other side this is on 7 where the sun in the spring hits the water, reflects up you\~get double sun on\~the rocks.  So I have all these exotic plants over there I can't grow any other places in the greenhouse or in the forest garden.  There's a pinyon tree that users a trellis there, and grapes after all the way to the top of\~the pinyon tree.  We have 25 different varieties of grapes.  \line \tab       It's a very lush landscape we can use slope to our advantage we don't have to worry about shade because we use stacking, the rocks create micro climates }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8451}{\*\bkmkend ldl8451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}like you mentioned, every southern exposure 300 miles south I am already down in New Mexico to start with right.  Then we have all the medicine herbs and ground cover.  Sometimes you have a\~very special gift from a seedling tree, this is a seedling }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8501}{\*\bkmkend ldl8501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}mulberry tree I call this Basalt less it's a 3 months reduction we're still eating Mulberries now, there's still a\~lot on, I have 4 or 5 other Mulberry trees, seedling ones, they are ask around the whole garden and they are on different micro }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8551}{\*\bkmkend ldl8551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}climates so we get every fruit fruits for about 4 months.  Most of\~the time we have apricots and in 2 weeks they are gone I have 20 varieties of apricots in different microclimates I will be eating apricots in\~a month from now, and we started }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8602}{\*\bkmkend ldl8602}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}in June.  \line \tab       So the say way we\~have earlier, late and middle season ones, still on the tree, eating them when I left.  Another gift from God, a plum peachcot which it came through off a seed, so it has a peach, plum and an apricot taste.  This is just a seedling I\~was going to pull up and I forgot about it and it\~was off the side to of\~the garden I just left it there so we have to trust in the seed and we're saving now all the seeds from every apricot, washing them putting them in\~the freezer then we'll do seedling trees and all\~the other things except for apples.  So 25 varieties of grapes, mostly table grapes but I\~think with climate change all of this fruit will\~be moving higher up in elevations up\~to 7, 8,000 feet.  A\~lot of the vineyard in lower elevation in Colorado and peach orchard are losing their fruit every earth year so they will be out of business, so when in doubt, go higher.  \line \tab       Peaches the same way.  We }{\*\bkmkstart ldl8801}{\*\bkmkend ldl8801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}have 15 different kinds of plums, we have already eaten these and put them in\~the freezer we're looking to Nancy coming on really late it's a very nice small French plum.  Apples, 20 varieties, we salvage some of\~the heirlooms that are down in the valley, there\~are hundred years old and graft them on to good root stock.  I have many good heirloom varieties myself I have some in my backpack right now I am eating some crab apples that are delicious.  This a typical harvest from one day, we don't sell anything anymore we burned out on market farming and we just give it away, trade it, and put it up for the winter.  We have smoothies every day with bananas and figs.  I\~was thinking if we have any bug out bag people here that have their pack ready to go, this is how you can live out in\~the wilderness if you are ready to take that challenge and we build these, since we have filled up the forest garden we have no place to plant anything, except unless a tree dies so we're going up in the pinyon and Juniper which we had to clear a little bit and we're building these I call them Polish hugelculture swales, and we have students doing the earth works, and they are amazingly productive we just land all\~the dead branches on\~the conture, dig a trench underneath there and last year in this one we planted squash, now we got garlic, then we move into summer crops.  There's just a thin veneer of soil in there but it grows like crazy there a lot of mushrooms in there, we scatter them, this will eventually be a forest garden.  It's great to watch the transition, and we have already got apricot trees in there , the deer come in, they eat what they need, they never bother our food, wild turkeys come in there the ground cover I planted for them, we dance with the bears, things work out.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\} \line \tab       Then going back\~to our annual production, inside we planted annuals for 15 years or so Basel in the summer, in the winter time, we have different crops every year I have archery range in my greenhouses all\~the time, just shooting my bow.  We gutted everything in sheet mulch the bed put in\~a very primitive greenhouse, a few years later it burnt down and that was a blessing disguise because I\~was able to retool and build with different technologies and different materials I salvaged all the steel for this green house, my entire house is built from salvage, it was a community effort to get it back and now it's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl9301}{\*\bkmkend ldl9301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}a beautiful lush tropical greenhouse.  We built our soils again with sheet mulching and hugelculture right in place, and while we're building them we were drawing our annuals, for one gallon pots so we could immediately plant it, get into production and let the soils digest, we have tomatoes and eggplants.  This will eventually be\~a tropical greenhouse, a few months later on\~the west side we planed our tropical perennial, all\~the species you would plant in the drop tropics.  We planned a crop of brassicas.   It only takes about less than year for an entire thing to close canopy.  There's a sleeping platform in the corner, the way we heat these greenhouses is with solar geothermal, I call it Polish geothermal because I spent 20 years helping develop this programme, the tower in the back is\~the intake tower for the warm air in\~the greenhouse we store in the soil and we can bring it out at night.  So it's very simple technology, you just bring in\~the warm hot air into the soil, that's your reservoir, you bring it out with the same fan in the same direction, again archery range there, it's another place where a hang out hammock there's a door to sauna is also a back up.  The patio, the wall are all thermal mass, lots of things that heat the greenhouse.  We even put in\~a pallet stove.  This is eventually going on\~the east side we left our annuals in there for a couple of years until we sort out what we were actually knowing to do, pretty soon it filled in that's all passion fruit there, it shades the patio so it doesn't over heat the greenhouse so we don't have to cool the greenhouse in the summer time, we just rely on natural convention.  Then there is the passionfruit eventually died out and we replaced it with annual beans, again succession.  Now it's got pomegranate, papaya and an under story of medicinal plants, in doors and outdoors, ginger, spilantis, comfrey, all in the under story, we have a business where we sell tinctures, the papaya is on the left, the canopy closes in, there is always room for changing everything else.  On the north wall we have the business stuff, geo tea machine, we make compost tea, aquaponics, a tank.  Pathways are a warm farm, on the other side of that is a tropical nursery, there isn't one }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}square}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} foot in this place that is wasted, many wraps of bananas it nice when one comes up in a design course so someone can harvest that, it }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:20001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}takes three people.  All the animals recycle our carbon, ducks, rabbits and chickens, cut and carry weeds, comfrey nitrogen fixing stuff, we have no animal costs, they value add all the mulch, it goes out on the trees, sell warms, warms casting and tea.  From I started a business and invited a partner in, Michael Thompson, an architect, now we do this on a commercial basis, I don't have the slides on here.  This is our first commercial project, a 600 acre ranch in Steam boat, a big greenhouse like phoenix, much more expensive, many smaller green houses and there is an acre forest garden here.  This is the sketch up design of the beds with key holes and aquaculture tanks there and the trellis and the heating tubes in the back there bring in the soil.  Some of these are very commercial, large-scale operations.  This is in the inside of that.  It was planned with my plants at the same time, I planted it in 09; it's a lush tropical greenhouse now.  You can see we excavate and use off-the-shelf ADS pipe and use culverts from ADS and back fill it, those are the distribution tubes for the - this is one we did with the Domes we put the climate battery in the Domes, you can see that sketch and umm... this is the finished dome, this is a living classroom for a high school that I help fund and this is the teacher uses it as a spilantis, in the bottom right hand corner, favourite herb, anti microbial and good for the immune system.  I work with }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}everybody}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}, to help with his banana farm, creating better soils with my probes mycelium and mulching.  Microbes, this is another greenhouse we have done, the CSA Farm School, they grow tomatoes and egg plants here commercially and cucumbers, we work with aquaponic systems at the grow house and we put the climate battery in this large hydroponic operation at the grow house and they sell their produce to Whole Foods and they use the money to support some of their educational programmes, this project is in a food desert in the middle of Denver, Adam is a teacher in due sign course, 30 years coming up, the longest in the world I guess.  So that's my story.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}.  . \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Thank you very much Jerome, that was just awesome, bananas at 2500m, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:20502"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}that's, yes, something aspire to.  So I imagine there are a lot of questions, so who wants to start?  Over there. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Hello, I'm Anthony Melville, from London, could you explain a bit more about what a 'Climate battery', is. \line JEROME OSENTOWSKI:  You know, people walk in my greenhouse and they say to me, "Where is the heat coming from, do you have a boiler or something", I take them outside and point at the sun.  You have a greenhouse, it gets very warm in there, you close the doors and it gets very warm.  In the winter time we never open the doors, we take the hot hair and put it in the soil with fans, just simple fans, forget water, simple, hot warm air, there is a phase change when the warm moist air hits the cool pipes down at four or five feet, you get an exponential amount of energy flashing, just like when you freeze water and thaw it out, there is a massive energy exchange, it's not just arithmetic, it's geometric, does that answer your question, take warm air from the greenhouse, put it in the soil with fans, thermostat, 70, charges the soil all day long, 50 at night and discharges in the same direction just taking a little bit of that 70 soil out and warming the air back again, just for a few hours, right.  It's not the any thing that heats the greenhouse, we have lots of insulation, thermal mass, saunas, pellet stove, we are almost net zero, though.  With my PVs everything is run-off the grid, pretty much. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Can I ask a question related to this, I'm Vala from Iceland. \line JEROME OSENTOWSKI:  Yes. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  So you have pipes underneath the soil. \line JEROME OSENTOWSKI:  You saw them, yes. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  I saw them.  Then you put soil on top of them and you blow the hot air into the pipes. \line JEROME OSENTOWSKI:  You are getting there. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  I'm getting there!  Ok!

I'm Hilta. \line JEROME OSENTOWSKI:  I can't hear you. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  I'm... Hilta from the Netherlands.  I\~have the same question about the Polish hugel soils, hugelculture. \line JEROME OSENTOWSKI:  We did hugelculture of sorts before we knew about the stuff, we stored and dumped for 20 years, we dumped big logs and boards that didn't have paint on them, eventually we got around to, it was just a place to throw things, eventually we got around to putting some subsoil on top of that, a foot or so, then annual gardening and now it's forest gardening, you can't slow the forest garden down, it's one of these things, it's a virus, you know that, it's just like, we have it all.  You plant something and... it just... it just keeps, you know, we have plum thickets, one of the nice things about plums they spread on your own, you have to plant one and you have 12 and they will the space nicely.  Did I answer the question. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  I'm just wondering what a specific 'Polish', hugel. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  He's Polish, he's making a joke. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Just ordinary hugelculture but you are just making a joke. \line JEROME OSENTOWSKI:  It's a variation on what Sepp does, he users tractors and moves big logs, even in our garden beds I'll throw branches this big, anything I'm cutting I'll throw it down at the bottom, then I'm starting to fill it up with anything, rotten manure, hey, you though worms in there mycelium, in two years I\~have this much in\~one greenhouse, this much of warm castings, I\~have that much, I didn't show\~you that one, you can build soils in a few months.  Six months you are building a millennium of soil, forget composting, this is compositing in place, that's what nature does, up in the Aspens, trees fall down and rots, no\~one goes up there and dead-heads!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  It's natural.  We have got a grant to limb up an acre for fire protection, I took them, mostly Pinon and conifer, I didn't want to hip them I didn't have the money, just dug a trench behind it, that's is where we made the Polish swales, I can say that, I'm Polish.

Do you have any?  . \line JEROME OSENTOWSKI:  Pest problems, oh.  Yeah, we have all the problems, but we deal with them in natural ways.  We are malting all the time, we have all kind of shredders, if you want to put a small lettuce seedling in, we have had spider mouse, compost heat kills most things, I've\~got through the whole gamut of doing all sorts of biology sprays, we don't have no insect problems outside garden, not ever, we folio-feed it, that gives everything a boost we do that every month now, we deep feed with mycelium, we can do that on a commercial basis, yet we have had lots of problems but we always solve them, we have never been run out of a greenhouse.  I can't get people to do the gardening, even though we build a greenhouse and train people.  The annual unmullched gardening is so entrenched in a world, with John Devon and Elliot Coleman, bless themselves, the whole mentality of not mulching, being afraid of mulching, being afraid of embracing nature is so abrasive people are doing to have trouble with gardening and insect control.  We bring in the insects as\~well, we open up the garden to lace wings, we sometimes introduce beneficials, if you have lots of mulch and the soil is happy the trees are happy and will not be attacked by insects, that's what we have learned over 25 years.  It's not to say we don't have problems, we are just not reacting to things, we are anticipating.  That's the key, to anticipate. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Right up there. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Hello everyone.  Hello Jerome.  I'm Christopher, I love you so much, so much mad respect, crazy respect for you. \line JEROME OSENTOWSKI:  I love you. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  You are a mad scientist, which is the highest accolade I can offer to anybody!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  The question I have for you, what was the inspiration, how did you come up with this idea, you are working with one of the most challenging areas to do any farming, let alone - I live in the topics, I'm looking at the tropical sections of your greenhouse, it looks pretty good.  So how did you come up with this?  . \line JEROME OSENTOWSKI:  Well I worked in the tropics too, }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:22002"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}I helped people to do a demonstration farm in northern Nicaragua, I travelled all over doing tropical consulting and growing.  After the greenhouse burnt down, I just wanted to do it properly, I wanted to take all the tropical plants that I know about and like to eat and grow them.  With the technology that we have, that we developed, my partner and I, we can do it without fossil fuels.  I mean, greenhouse companies are still building shells that are glazed on all sides, they just plug in a gas heater and they forget about saving energy, but it's just - well all of the things we learned in permaculture, right, all the things, you know, follow the principles.  If you run everything you do through the principles you well come up with what I did.  I think that's it.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  So just\~one more question up there and then we have to close I'm afraid. \line JEROME OSENTOWSKI:  You have to speak right in to the microphone. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Hi there Annalise Australia, Gaia craft.  I'm very interested in your foliage spray that might help the people in Kuwait. \line JEROME OSENTOWSKI:  Compost, Elaine this compost queen of the world and then this other fellow, Bob, who makes the geode  machine, commercial 250 gallon machine that sits in a tote, I saw it demonstrating in Hawaii, I said we need to get one over here, we have about five in the valley now, they're all running commercial businesses out of them, taking them around doing sick trees, meadows, increasing productivity.  We recently built a simple one off the internet, 60 gallon one, off-the-shelf, pipes, simple one, then we use the good warm castings and then we use mycelium, haemic acid, some sweetener, something to make it stick.  There is one thing I couldn't remember right now, it goes in there as well.  Any way, it's a brew.  You do it for 24 hours and the microbes just explode geometrically.  That's what does the magic.  Does that answer your question. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  Thank you. \line JEROME OSENTOWSKI:  You could do it in a five gallon bucket with a little bubbler you can whisk it on with a brush, or you can poor it in and water your plants with it, right there nutrient rich, we like to play classical music and spray with high pressure sprayers, one of my citrus had black mould, I\~have a key lime it's got about 3 or 4 hundred limes of it, fruiting for four years, seven different citrus that }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:22501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}are fruiting, 25 or 30 that I graft on to dwarfing root stock, so I have a citrus crop, it will be going south in Florida, you can get your citrus from me \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line TOMAS REMIARZ:  Thank you very much again, Jerome Osentowski \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}.

Do you think?  No, no, no, she\~was talked about more as she led this underground rail road, but let's think about this.  This the south a first of all she\~was born on a farm, a home setting farm and it\~was only her relationship with }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11101}{\*\bkmkend ldl11101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the forest that enabled her to design the path that she needed to get Africans who were enslaved to freedom, she understood the food, what was growing, she had a relationship with the land.  She wasn't talked about that way when I\~was raised }{\*\bkmkstart ldl11151}{\*\bkmkend ldl11151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}so I wasn't able to see sustainability in her story related.  }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

However, if somebody had made those connections and connected the dates it would have made a lot more sense.  I don't know if anyone else had an experience like that, where sustainability or the environment hasn't been relevant for you.  Does anybody know who the person in the bottom right hand corner is?  Peanuts.  George Washington Carver, he's accredited for a million uses for the peanuts, again this is a lot of US history, people don't talk a lot about he built his entire laboratory using recycled parts, he wanted to talk about earth care, people care and fair share.  Sound familiar?  He wanted to talk about the triple bottom line and how in the south could we rebuild the soil but also figure out how to take care of the people and also share the resources.  Again I had to go back and fetch those stories, I had to make those relevant, it wasn't current for me when I crew up, part of my journey is about how to create relevance in my own life so I can see myself in the movement we are part of.  Specifically when I got turned on to permaculture, again it was at the moment of, how can I make this more relevant to the people in my community, for the people I'm in touch }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:23001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}with and even for the people in my family.  Anyone else had that question, try to make it more relevant?  Anyone here, I'm from the black church, we do something in the black church, called 'Called and response', so I go like that and you go yeah, if you hear me, you feel me!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  I'm being real!  .  So everybody loves to talk about principles in permaculture, for those of you that haven't studied permaculture necessarily, have your PDC talk to me later, it's rooted in ethics but also principles, everyone likes to quote the problem is the solution, I know what the problem is, the problem is the solution.  A lot of committed to work around incarceration, who are turned on and passionate about permaculture, wanted to put permaculture design to the test, ok if this idea is really true, let's see if permaculture design applies to one of the biggest problem in the world today, really facing us in California, it's really impacting all of you who live in the UK, can you raise your hand Nicole - where is she?  My friend Nicole is doing some work now, if you can find her, she's talking about abolition of the prisons, I'm talking about California, but a lot of that is happening round here where we're at too. \line \tab       Specifically in the United States the pattern of people being incarcerated, 60% of those are called 'Communities of colour' African-American, Latin\~American, it's impacted my family and taken off.  Are people of colour 60% of American population. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  No. \line PANDORA THOMAS:  50% - are we doing 60% of the crime. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  No. \line PANDORA THOMAS:  So there is definitely a pattern of who is showing up incarcerated, that is not in line with reality on the ground, so that's a problem.  So actually some of the people in California who are leaders are trying to tackle.  Jerry brown our governor due to a lot of lobbying and force from a lot of organisations, came up with something called the 'Safety political realignment', the idea is not only are there are disproportionate number of people being incarcerated, the same pattern showing up in my family, but there is not even enough beds to house all the people, and it's way too expensive.  So the idea of public safety realignment, how do we take people who have done non-violent offences from prisons, put them in }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}jails}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} and then release them back to the community, the idea of non-violent, I don't know if it's the same here in the UK, but it's one of the ideas. \line \tab       Again, the problem again is there are tense of thousands of people returning back to California but into a broken system.

You are trying to reintegrate into a system that already had tears and breaks in when you left.  So the problem, tens of thousands of people released into a broken system of re-entry, wow, again can permaculture speak to that. \line \tab       So that problem, coupled with what Brock Doleman, one of my teaching, global weirding, I I'm going to add one more problem, the problem of recidivism, people who get out get back in straight away.  We don't want that, this idea of global weirding.  If that's the problem, what's the solution. \line FROM THE FLOOR:  The problem!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  . \line PANDORA THOMAS:  You read my - seriously thought!  Tens of thousands of people coming home, the problem is the solution, what's the solution.  Tens of thousands of people are coming back into our communities, you get it, the problem is the solution.  Now, the problem, we only see them coming back into our communities when we are separate from them, but when we see them as coming back into our communities and we give them what I like to call the 'Mandela Welcome', remember when Mandela came home, that's the slide, 15 minutes after he came home, what was the world done, "Mandela's free", singing and dancing, no matter what happened, there was a level of welcoming him back to our communities, wanting to learn from what he had gone through, wanting to understand.  So that's the opportunity, potential, that when people come from this experience and come back into our communities, that's when it becomes a solution.  So, we wanted to design a system an experience that can put permaculture design to a test, to see if when these folks come back home is there a way to really fulfil the potential, to create a solutions-based design for people re-entering our community.

I will go step-by-step showing you my ideas of what we want to create in eastern and southern Africa.  With the your support, I\~think we're going to\~achieve in the next few years.   I }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12001}{\*\bkmkend ldl12001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}am African,\~I am coming from Africa, that's Africa, and I am going\~to talk a little about more on this part.  Which is\~the southern and eastern Africa.  The southern eastern Africa consists of about 21 countries, but according to commersa and it's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12051}{\*\bkmkend ldl12051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}about 26 countries, the COMESA that is lead by the Government, the countries heads of state they actually run the COMESA, I will explain a bit about it.  COMESA is\~the Common\~Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, it's lead by Presidents or Prime Minister's }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12101}{\*\bkmkend ldl12101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of the countries in the eastern and southern Africa.  And also the eastern anticipate southern Africa is also southern African development community.  Also, it's the supported by the eastern Africa community.  All involved they are under the African union, which is led by the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12151}{\*\bkmkend ldl12151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}President Robert Mugabe currently.  \line \tab       A little bit about background for agriculture in Africa is that not in southern Africa, is that agriculture production is central to region development, at least 70% of the population depends on agriculture for food, income and employment.  Systems }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12201}{\*\bkmkend ldl12201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is mixed there we have organic farming, permaculture, animal farming, a number of farming activities that are there even forestry, bee-keeping and others.  The agriculture contributes about 35% to region's gross domestic product and 40% of the population live below}{\*\bkmkstart ldl12251}{\*\bkmkend ldl12251}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} the international poverty line of US one dollar per day.  \line \tab       Only 5% of all land is arable, but only 45% of this land is cultivated and only 4% of\~the cultivated land is under irrigation, this irrigation is only directed to}{\*\bkmkstart ldl12301}{\*\bkmkend ldl12301}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} the most privileged monoculture farmers.  \line \tab       According to UNICEF about 2.5 billion people will be there in 2050, and the challenge there is\~the food security.  Who is going\~to feed these people, what system of farming do we need to employ or to put }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12351}{\*\bkmkend ldl12351}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}to feed these people.  \line \tab       The system that take care of the environment, whilst producing food and I know\~the answer is permaculture.  The majority of the population will be women, youth and as you know in southern Africa, women (inaudible) in famine.  Women are }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12401}{\*\bkmkend ldl12401}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}the pillars of food security but after we giving them chance to lead us, there's a question there.  \line \tab       For the youth, what system of education are we putting in place, to encourage the youth to understand permaculture or agriculture.  Mostly we send our children }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12451}{\*\bkmkend ldl12451}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}for white collar job training.  It's a challenge for the future.  In Africa we have a problem of land grabbing in Africa, the land grab is done by corporates, or international corporates and it's sort of another colonisation, and we are saying no in the word }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12501}{\*\bkmkend ldl12501}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}of permaculture.  We also have problem of land grab within countries by politicians.  They take land, without proper systems, without proper channels, this land goes, what shall we do it's usually part of the tribalism that politics that influence that.  The }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12551}{\*\bkmkend ldl12551}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}allocation of land is again who knows who in Africa, we have a challenge.  Who is suffering most is the smallholder farmer.  The household.  When you talk about smallholder farmer we encompasses, we are focusing on the rural areas of Africa or }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12601}{\*\bkmkend ldl12601}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}southern Africa, where these people they do not have access, most of\~the land that they have is a reserve land.  What does that mean, it means the land belonging to Government and they are there temporarily there, they can be removed at any time.  Like }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12651}{\*\bkmkend ldl12651}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}what is happening in Mozambique, 4 million people will\~be moved for the Pro-Savannah project to grow biofuel \line \tab       Food policing by African union middle class people industrialised food systems rather than smallholder farmer, but, statistics tells me that 70% of regional food comes from smallholder }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12701}{\*\bkmkend ldl12701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}farmer but we are not supported.   GMO industrial agriculture intensive farming, monoculture farms, supported by some Government like in South\~Africa, 80% of the maize that is grown in Africa is GMO.  Although an advantage of other southern African }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12751}{\*\bkmkend ldl12751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}countries, they rejected GMO, but it's been attracting again in\~the means of where they are introducing nutrients into the food it's part of the GMO processes.  \line \tab       Land distribution is also going to unskilled people in the name of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12801}{\*\bkmkend ldl12801}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}what, when we are towards elections you will find that the Government can campaign and they promise they will give you land and people they get so that the Government will get their votes.  In certain countries in eastern and southern Africa.  It is known that small holder farmers systems }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12851}{\*\bkmkend ldl12851}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}are underdeveloped but not on the agenda of African heads of states.   They do not have access to running water, and they do have poor land or poor soils where they live.  Food aid to Africa created dependence to local people, you will find that when }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12901}{\*\bkmkend ldl12901}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}there\~is a disasters you find food is being distributed in Africa, but we don't nowhere it is coming from, we don't know what is in the food, but once the process what are we trying to do, are we teaching them how to fish or we're giving them fish? }{\*\bkmkstart ldl12951}{\*\bkmkend ldl12951}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}You find that in the region there\~is promotion of biofuel where a\~lot of the trees plants are grown, sugar cane is grown for biofuel we don't need biofuel we need food.  \line \tab       Some food are grown for dogs, specifically in some food }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13001}{\*\bkmkend ldl13001}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}are grown specifically to feed dairy and meat animals.  Imagine the process, in the process we manage to get\~a piece of meat.  Why can't we just go probably promote vegetarian in the region so we grow food specifically for the people, not for animals.  \line \tab  }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13051}{\*\bkmkend ldl13051}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}    There\~is a challenge also on the erosion of biodiversity and culture of diversity, because even in our culture we tend to forget who we are.  As black people of southern Africa we did forget our culture, and we have the challenges of erosion of }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13101}{\*\bkmkend ldl13101}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}mining, when a mine come into an area it takes over the rights of water.  Then the people they suffer, they do not have water.  The natural resources the desertification is happening in our evidence because of monoculture farming that is a\~lot by the }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13151}{\*\bkmkend ldl13151}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Government of heads of states of eastern and southern Africa.  \line \tab       Nutrition insecurity is one of the challenges we found in the region the region talk about food security but when they talk about food security what do they mean?  They mean growing maize, maize }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13201}{\*\bkmkend ldl13201}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}is not of our origin, it doesn't come from Africa it comes from Mexico.  Their maize.

We will get all our food within the farm, at a household level and the land was just less than 5 hectares, all the food was coming from them, mushroom, a number of things were coming, we never go to shop to buy like what I'm doing right now, I don't go to shop to buy food so I learn from my father, but we are lucky Bill Mollison introduced the word 'Permaculture', we didn't know the system we were practising was permaculture or what, that's why it was easy for me to take the permaculture feather.  So as you know the history of permaculture in Africa, it actually started in 1987 when Bill Mollison came and did a course on permaculture, Bridget O'Connor attended who is here, after that we introduce it to Fambidzanai where I get trained in the late eighties from there permaculture study spread and introduced to organisations like Rescope, Pelum and other organisations in Zimbabwe.  It moves into South Africa, it moves in to the region and supported by different organisation and we have quite great movement in southern Africa about permaculture, in particular in Zimbabwe, nearly all NGOs and the government institution, they learnt about permaculture, but we still have a problem that we think, that we try to explain it today.  Permaculture created jobs, business and improved life styles of a number of people and influenced the policies at a certain level.  For example Rescope is working in schools and they influence a lot on the school curriculum and also Pelum influenced a certain levels in Zimbabwe and also in South Africa we have organisations that are influencing permaculture into the government.  On behalf of the community.  Sorry, my papers are not organised well!  I'm not a politician!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line \tab       Ok, challenges in the permaculture, we found that permaculture is not in the mainstream education, but I still acknowledge the }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}work}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} of Rescope in the region, but we need to put more effort into it so that we change the face of Africa, or southern Africa. \line \tab       Permaculture concept is a challenge to grasp, specially at government and the academic level because its complex and it can put corporates out of business, easy.  So they tend to brush it out, they tend to, as if they tent understand it, and then, because they know, once they accept it we take over!  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Laughter}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line \tab       Permaculture sometimes is perceived as subsistence farming, no, it's not for subsistence farming.  Permaculture can be designed from subsistence to commercial.  The challenge is that some permaculture institutes, they train permaculture as in organic farming. }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:25501"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Permaculture is not organic, organic is part of permaculture.  Permaculture is broad.  Agro ecology is a tool for permaculture, but if you start teaching people the soil fertility and say it's permaculture, no that's just a tool, permaculture is broader, it's everything, it's a way of life. \line \tab       Sometimes most of permaculture practitioners fail to demonstrate better yield per hectare.  In South Africa demonstrated and I challenged the Monsanto farmers.  They produce 0.7 kilogram per square metre, whilst I produce 1.2 kilogram of Maize per square meter on my farm.  \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}. \line \tab       The seed I don't buy, I keep my own seeds \{}{\s31\f0\fs24\i\lang2057{\*\listtag0}Applause}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\}.  I don't use synthetic chemicals and I don't use synthetic fertiliser and spray and pesticide, I use my natural pesticide from plants which I grow in the farm and spray.  You find in rural areas or smallholder farmers they don't own 100% of that land, they don't have title deeds this is a movement we need to address with the Head of State.  To say if someone is occupying land to practice permaculture, it's for life, it's a permanent system, should own the land, not belong to government.  The government should organise we get the land and it comes into our own hands and we have title deeds, then we can practice properly permaculture. \line \tab       We also - permaculture, - when the commercial farmers, in terms of resources, it's because we don't have permaculture experts and policy makers, we dent have permaculturists as members of Parliament, that's the thing we need to address and see how we can have representatives in Parliaments. \line \tab       We, yes we have a problem with in equitable land allocation, rich land or fertile land goes usually to commercial farmers who are producing one type of crop for exportation and sometimes they are growing food for biofuel.  Whilst the people who are growing food for themselves, they cannot have good life they live in the same type of soils. \line \tab       Why small householder farmers should exist.  Directly they contribute to food sovereignty and that's our movement, we need food sovereignty, not food security.  Particularly for the most vulnerable people.  Climate change, food crisis, population increase, it's not an issue, because if you understand permaculture properly, you can have a cushion, you can control, you can have - climate change can be mitigated.  Having direct immediate impact on hunger and poverty, traditionally they have mitigation means like fruits, wild insects, you all know what happened in Zimbabwe in 2008, there was the colony of Zimbabwe went down and many people they couldn't manage to have }{\field{\*\fldinst {\f1\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0} HYPERLINK "pid:26001"}}{\*\fldrslt}}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}access to food but they managed to be resilient in that we are using the natural resources or the resources that are within their own environment. }{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}\par}

They have political challenges, they reduce emissions and sequestrate carbon in their own farms.  They put trees around their farms, around the homestead, indigenous trees for medicine, forage, that's all a way of sequestrating carbon, they are skilled and carry a vast left of experience.  The waste is recycled within, you don't see plastic like what you see in urban areas, you don't see litter in the area, they have a good level of waste management and they use everything that they have, it's recycled of used for something.  They have sustainable systems, known as nodes.  We want to create that together, when they come together, they create what they call a 'Node', a node is a system where different activities happen to support the, the food system and the system of the community.

For example, we have worked on these types of nodes, like in vendor, we have created in South Africa, where we trained the community and they understand each other they found themselves, formed themselves into a group and they contribute towards one thing and they grow food for themselves and they bring in renewable energy in the community, but what is required there to form the nodes is to support them in organising or organising themselves.  Also, in Zimbabwe we are trying to make sure that we set the nodes as\~well. \line \tab       Ok.  We, with the nodes, because the nodes are important in the, in the existence of smallholder farmer, because they can share knowledge freely, they don't need to go to a school where they pay a lot of money because children in the community sometimes, in rural areas they don't have excess of money to send children to university, if they create nodes the investment is in the community.

Organise a food movement, }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13701}{\*\bkmkend ldl13701}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}address farmer rights, because you know in Africa sometimes the farmers don't even know their rights.

Then we say yes to 9 patterned open pollinated seeds and access to }{\*\bkmkstart ldl13751}{\*\bkmkend ldl13751}{\s31\f0\fs24\lang2057{\*\listtag0}markets for sharing our products, not biofuel products, genetically engineered seeds, we say no to that.
